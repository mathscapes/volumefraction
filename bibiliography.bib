abstract = {Extensively updated and maintaining the high standard of the popular original, Principles of Composite Material Mechanics, Second Edition reflects many of the recent developments in the mechanics of composite materials. It draws on the decades of teaching and research experience of the author and the course material of the senior undergraduate and graduate level classes he has taught.New and up-to-date information throughout the text brings modern engineering students everything they need to advance their knowledge of the evermore common composite materials. The introduction strengthens the book's emphasis on basic principles of mechanics by adding a review of the basic mechanics of materials equations. New appendices cover the derivations of stress equilibrium equations and the strain-displacement relations from elasticity theory. Additional sections address recent applications of composite mechanics to nanocomposites, composite grid structures, and composite sandwich structures. More detailed discussion of elasticity and finite element models have been included along with results from the recent World Wide Failure Exercise. The author takes a phenomenological approach to illustrate linear viscoelastic behavior of composites. Updated information on the nature of fracture and composite testing includes coverage of the finite element implementation of the Virtual Crack Closure techniqueand new and revised ASTM standard test methods. The author includes updated and expanded material property tables, many more example problems and homework exercises, as well as new reference citings throughout the text.Requiring a solid foundation in materials mechanics, engineering, linear algebra, and differential equations, Principles of Composite Materials Mechanics, Second Edition provides the advanced knowledge in composite materials needed by today's materials scientists and engineers.},

abstract = {In blast and impact, structures usually undergo large plastic deformations or failure, and they absorb considerable energy. In this paper, the characteristics of blast loads and corresponding structural response, as well as the current advances in this area, were briefly reviewed. The concept and effects of blast wave, the main means of blast impact, are introduced. Several critical structural responses are classified and briefly illustrated. The major experimental methods were introduced with a brief description of corresponding experimental devices such as ballistic pendulums and a wide range of sensors to measure impulse, pressure and acceleration and displacement of structures. Several commonly used analytical models were presented and compared to estimate the dynamic behaviour of structure under blast loading. The numerical approaches to analyze the structure responses to blast impact were also summarised with a number of available constitutive relations of explosive charge and material properties of structures.},

abstract = {The concept of the span reduction factor (SRF) is commonly used to account for the level of correlation in the wind field. Previous studies conducted on real downbursts indicated that the associated wind field exhibits usually a higher correlation compared to a normal wind field. Consequently, values used for SRF in the design codes might not be suitable for downburst application. The current study focuses on obtaining the SRF of transmission line conductors under downbursts. An expression for the SRF is analytically derived. Downburst turbulence characteristics included in the analytical expression are obtained from a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. A validation of the developed analytical approach is conducted through a comparison with field measurements available in the literature. Graphs for the SRF are generated and compared with the corresponding values associated under normal winds. The comparison reveals the significant discrepancy between the normal wind and the downburst reduction factors},

abstract = {In order to explore the impact of gas temperature on the nozzle damping characteristics of solid rocket motor, numerical simulations were carried out by an experimental motor in Naval Ordnance Test Station of China Lake in California. Using the pulse decay method, different cases were numerically studied via Fluent along with UDF (User Defined Functions). Firstly, mesh sensitivity analysis and monitor position-independent analysis were carried out for the computer code validation. Then, the numerical method was further validated by comparing the calculated results and experimental data. Finally, the effects of gas temperature on the nozzle damping characteristics were studied in this paper. The results indicated that the gas temperature had cooperative effects on the nozzle damping and there had great differences between cold flow and hot fire test. By discussion and analysis, it was found that the changing of mainstream velocity and the natural acoustic frequency resulted from gas temperature were the key factors that affected the nozzle damping, while the alteration of the mean pressure had little effect. Thus, the high pressure condition could be replaced by low pressure to reduce the difficulty of the test. Finally, the relation of the coefficients "alpha" between the cold flow and hot fire was got.},

abstract = {Interlaminar stresses and strength in composite materials have long been a focus of research because they are related to the common failure mode of delamination. However, the determination of the through-thickness properties of composite materials is not a straightforward process. The through-thickness characterization of composite laminates is becoming increasingly critical for the reliable and robust design of thick composite components used in structural applications. Additionally, the out-of-plane strength parameters of composite laminates are of great importance in the verification of three-dimensional failure theories. In characterizing the through-thickness mechanical properties of a composite, the objective is to produce a state of stress in the test specimen which is uniform and will repeatedly measure the true properties with accuracy. In this study, specimens were machined from thick ({\~{}}25 mm) laminates of woven carbon fabric/epoxy and tested in compression, tension and shear. Straight-sided, waisted and V-notched specimens were used for direct load application using specially designed fixtures. In addition to obtaining reliable through-thickness properties of the material (F 3c , F 3t , F 31 , etc.), off-axis loading configurations produced a more general 3D state of stress in the test specimen. These through-thickness strength data were used for detailed analysis of the delamination failure process in composite materials and in the development of a new delamination failure theory.},

abstract = {A phenomenological-based micro-macro mechanical method, comprising the coupling of a 3D continuum damage mechanics (CDM) model with an original micromechanical FE model, is presented to predict low velocity impact response of composite laminates. The key point of the proposed method is the definition and computation of saturation crack density, which is used to scale impact-induced delamination instead of via expensive cohesive zone model based FEM. In order to gain the specific value of the saturation crack density, a micromechanical FE model is established based on the RVE technique. Additionally, the initiation of intralaminar failure including fiber fracture (FF) and inter-fiber fracture (IFF) is evaluated by Puck criteria, and its evolution, with considering effects of the fracture plane angle, is assumed to be controlled by equivalent strains on the fracture plane rather than the classic material principal axis plane. A good agreement between the experimental and simulated results shows correctness and effectiveness of the developed micro-macro mechanical method for predicting impact response and damage using a relatively coarse mesh. Furthermore, significant reduction of computational cost, compared with existing techniques, can be achieved with the novel mesh-independent method.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.We employ a genetic algorithm to maximize the energy dissipated per unit areal density in laminates composed of layers of poly-methyl-metha-acrylate (PMMA), adhesive and polycarbonate (PC) impacted at low velocity by a rigid hemi-spherical nosed cylinder. Sources of energy dissipation considered are plastic deformations of the PC and the PMMA, cracking of the PMMA, viscous deformations of the adhesive, and the energy used to deform failed elements that are deleted from the analysis domain. Some of the challenging issues are appropriate constitutive relations for the three materials, failure criteria, and numerical techniques to accurately analyze finite deformations of different constituents. We model the PC and the PMMA as thermo-elasto-visco-plastic materials with constitutive relations proposed by Mulliken and Boyce and modified by Varghese and Batra, the adhesive as a visco-elastic material, and use the commercial finite element software LS-DYNA in which these material models have been implemented as user defined subroutines. This software is coupled with a genetic algorithm to optimize the layup of the PC, the PMMA and the adhesive layers of the same thickness under the constraints that the top and the bottom layers are not adhesive, the PC and the PMMA layers must have an adhesive layer between them, and the total number of layers is fixed.},

Various energy absorbing mechanisms are delineated and an approximate equation for the ballistic limit is obtained.

Experimental results indicated that the combined core sandwich specimens provided increased stiffness, specific stiffness, energy absorption and critical load, which were higher than the sum of honeycomb core sandwich specimens and grid core sandwich specimens. In addition, a Finite Element Method (FEM) model was proposed to calculate the critical buckling load of the combined core sandwich structures. The effects of core heights, honeycomb-wall thickness and face-sheet thickness on the critical buckling loads of the combined core sandwich structures were examined.

abstract = {The mechanical properties of glass/epoxy composites are sensitive to applied loading rates. In the present research, a strain-rate dependent micromechanical (SRDM) method is developed to predict the strength of unidirectional (UD) polymeric composites under various loading rates. In this paper, the Goldberg et al. model, as a strain rate dependent constitutive equation of polymers, has been combined with a micromechanics model (the bridging matrix method) to predict the strength of UD composites at arbitrary strain rates. In addition, the bridging matrix method is modified by using strain concentration factor to determine the transverse tensile and in-plane shear strengths of UD composites. To verify the proposed model, first the dynamic mechanical behavior of glass fibers and epoxy matrix were studied experimentally. Then, the predicted results are compared with the available experimental data of glass/epoxy composites. A comparison between predicted results and available experimental data for longitudinal tensile, transverse tensile and in-plane shear strengths of UD glass/epoxy composites under various strain rates shows the capability of the proposed novel model. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The energy converted to heat during high strain rate plastic deformation is measured directly using an infra-red method for Ta-2.5{\%} W alloy and, indirectly, using UCSD's recovery Hopkinson bar technique for the same alloy, as well as for commercially pure Ti, 1018 steel, 6061 Al and OFHC Cu. The infra-red measurement yields a 70{\%} conversion of work to heat for Ta-2.5{\%} W and generally underestimates this factor for all tested materials. The final temperature at a given strain can be determined indirectly, based on the calculated plastic work. For this, three separate measurements are made: First, a sample is deformed at a high strain rate to a total strain of, say, 60{\%}; this is essentially an adiabatic test. Then a second sample is deformed at the same strain rate to about 30{\%} strain; this should reproduce the first half of the previous adiabatic stress-strain curve and in our test it does. This sample is then allowed to cool down to the initial room temperature. This sample may then be heated to the temperature as was measured by the infra-red detectors and then deformed at the same strain rate to check if the adiabatic curve is traced. It is observed that only when the sample temperature is increased based on 100{\%} conversion of the plastic work to heat, that the original adiabatic stress-strain curve is traced. It is thus concluded that the infra-red detection system records a lower (surface) temperature than the actual temperature of the sample. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

A relatively simple material model, based on continuum damage mechanics, has been proposed to describe the constitutive response of the composite material in the FMLs. Simulations of the blast response of FMLs with various stacking configurations has been carried out, capturing both perforation and non-perforation failure modes. Blast loading was modelled by a pressure function applied on the front face of the FML panel. The definition of the pressure function accounts for both the temporal as well as the spatial distribution of the blast. The capability of the models has been assessed by comparing the predictions associated with both low and high intensity blast cases with published experimental data. Good qualitative and quantitative agreement has been observed for lay-ups with similar proportions of aluminium and composite. It is believed that the models can be employed for use in parametric studies that would facilitate the adoption of FMLs in wider engineering design.},

Special attention is paid to the initial stage of the impact experiment and the effects of the specimen thickness, elastic impedances of flyer-anvil plates, and viscoplastic properties of materials on the time to reach a homogenous stress and deformation state within a specimen. The simple interpretation of experimental results which assumes a homogenous stress and deformation state within a specimen is found in general to be valid only at a much later time after impact. It is recommended that the measurement of the stress wave profiles should be made at the back face of the specimen rather than at its impact face, and that a pressure-shear stress wave analysis of the plate impact experiment should be performed to evaluate the inertial effects on the early part of experimental recordings. The comparison between measured stress wave profiles and the numerical simulation of the experiment provides a critical assessment of advanced viscoplastic models developed for applications under impact loading.

abstract = {This article reports the compressive behaviors of 3-D braided basalt fiber tows/epoxy composite materials under the temperature range of 23-210 degrees C with the strain-rate range of 1300-2300 s(-1). A split Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus with a heating device was designed to conduct the out-of-plane compression tests. It was found that compression modulus, specific energy absorption, and peak stress decreased with the elevated temperatures, while failure strain gradually increased with the elevated temperatures. Compression modulus and peak stress were more sensitive to the temperature effect, whereas failure strain and specific energy absorption were more easily affected by the strain rate effect. The plasticity can be divided into two types: a) the platform-shape plasticity; or (b) the slope-shape plasticity. The experimental condition of 150 degrees C with 1827 s(-1) was a dividing threshold to differentiate the compression-failure mode and the shear-failure mode. The authentic microstructural finite element analysis results revealed that the distribution and accumulation of the inelastic heat led to the development of shear bands. Braided reinforcement had an important influence on the damage characteristics. When the temperature was below T-g, the material underwent a significant temperature rise during failure. But above T-g, the temperature rise was relatively steady.},

abstract = {This series of papers reports a new, general, and unified micromechanical model for estimating the three-dimensional mechanical properties of a composite made from two constituent materials, i.e., continuous fiber and matrix. The linear elastic and elasto-plastic behaviors have been studied in Parts I and II respectively. The present paper investigates the tensile strength and failure mode of the composite. The tensile strength of the composite is predicted based on the ultimate stresses in the constituent phases, as the states of stresses in both phases are explicitly represented as the function of the applied overall stress field. The maximum normal stress theory for isotropic materials is incorporated with this prediction. As long as the maximum normal stress in either the fibers or the matrix attains its ultimate value, the composite is considered to fail, and the corresponding strength and failure mode are thus automatically defined. This makes determination of the composite strength as well as the failure mode extremely general, yet particularly easy. The composite can be subjected to any kind of load combination, whereas the corresponding strength behavior is determined through the same simple procedure. Comparisons between predicted and measured tensile strengths for several unidirectional composites under off-axial loads and for a plain weft-knitted fabric-reinforced composite under different uniaxial loads confirm that the present micromechanical strength theory is very efficient.},

abstract = {The thermal and mechanical properties of sustainable lightweight engineered geopolymer composites (EGCs), exhibiting strain-hardening behavior under uniaxial tension, are reported in this study. Fly ash-based geopolymer was used as complete replacement of cement binder to significantly increase the environmental sustainability of the composite compared to the engineered cementitious composite (ECC). Additionally, three types of lightweight aggregates including expanded perlite, microscopic hollow ceramic spheres and expanded recycled glass were used as complete replacement of micro-silica sand to reduce density and thermal conductivity of the composite. The influences of the type of aggregates on the fresh and hardened properties of the composite including matrix workability, density, compressive strength, thermal conductivity and uniaxial tensile performance were experimentally evaluated. The results indicated that the density and compressive strength of all EGCs developed in this study, even the EGC containing normal weight micro-silica sand, were less than 1833 kg/m3and more than 43.4 MPa, respectively, meeting the density and compressive strength requirements for structural lightweight concrete. Replacing normal weight micro-silica sand with lightweight aggregates reduced the compressive and tensile strengths of the EGCs by a maximum of 24{\%} and 32{\%}, respectively. However, the tensile ductility of the EGCs containing lightweight aggregates was comparable to that of the EGC containing micro-silica sand. In addition, the thermal conductivity of the EGCs containing lightweight aggregates were significantly (38–49{\%}) lower than that of the EGC containing normal weight micro-silica sand, resulting in an end-product that is greener, lighter, and provides better thermal insulation than ECC.},

abstract = {In the present study, the ballistic limit of GLARE is investigated experimentally and numerically. Ballistic tests were conducted using one stage gas gun. In the experimental part, the ballistic limit of GLARE was determined. The effect of aluminum lamina thickness and the nose shape of projectile on the ballistic limit were also investigated. The experimental results show that the ballistic limit of GLARE impacted by a flat projectile is higher than in the case of a conical nose projectile, and that by decreasing the aluminum laminate thickness from 0.5 mm to 0.3 mm, the Specific Perforation Energy (SPE) is increased. In the numerical section, the penetration process was simulated using LS–DYNA software. The validation of the finite element model was done by experimental results. The effects of various involved parameters such as laminate thickness, mass and radii of impactor were also investigated. The numerical results prove the efficiency of GLARE over bare aluminum laminate with equal thickness, due to the lower deflection and higher SPE. Furthermore, the less the mass of the impactor or the greater the diameter of the flat projectile, the greater the ballistic limit of GLARE. Reasonable agreement is concluded between the numerical and experimental results.},

The proportion of birth defects in the exposed group was not significantly different from that in the control group. This observation must be considered within the limitations of the study, which could detect only a strong teratogenic effect. It could not exclude risks lower than a 5.7-fold increase in the incidence of birth defects when chloroquine was used. Women using chloroquine during pregnancy for chemosuppression of malaria can be reassured that it is not a strong teratogen, but if it is to be used the risk of developing malaria should be balanced against the lack of data to determine whether it carries a low teratogenic risk.},

The tensile modulus in the glassy state was seen to be predominantly related to intermolecular packing, while in the rubbery state crosslink density was the important factor. Yielding appeared to be due to an increase in free volume as a result of dilatation during the tensile test and was related to a critical shear stress. The large strain properties like tensile strength, elongation-to-break, and toughness showed a more complex dependence on chemical structure, molecular architecture, intermolecular packing, and crosslink density. The roles played by the relaxation processes in determining mechanical properties are highlighted.},

The materials tested were divided into two groups: non-mineralized and mineralized. The former demonstrated the highest impact strength and showed strong dependence on water content, while the latter were relatively brittle and demonstrated no dependence on water content.

abstract = {Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites are increasingly used in civil, naval, aerospace, and wind energy applications, where they can be frequently exposed to harsh temperature conditions and under static and dynamic loads. The extreme temperature conditions and dynamic loading are critical for CFRP composites structural design as the constituent polymer properties are highly sensitive to temperature and strain rate. This work experimentally investigates the effect of temperature, ranging from −100 °C to 100 °C, on the mechanical properties of CFRP composites under static and dynamic three-point bending tests. The results reveal that CFRP composites provide enhanced flexural strength, maximum deflection, and energy absorption at lower temperatures (−60 °C, −100 °C) while relatively poor performance at a higher temperature (100 °C). Experimental images from the post-mortem photographs, scanning electron microscopy, and high speed videos are implemented to observe various failure behaviors including microbuckling, kinking, and fiber breakage at different temperatures. Analytical modeling is further applied to reveal the underlying mechanisms responsible for these temperature dependent mechanical behaviors. The findings reported here provide insights into the study of the temperature effect on the mechanical response of CFRP composites, which expands the way to design stiffer, stronger and tougher CFRP composites.},

Second, the post-damage softening response is controlled by a linear form damage evolution law combined with the fracture energy approach. Stiffness progressive reduction is characterized by a variable determined by equivalent displacement for each failure mode and in doing so the mesh dependency can be reduced appreciably. Third, strain rate dependency of the strength and the modulus of FRP laminated materials are also considered. Comparisons are made between the present numerical results and some available test data.

In the VCCT–XLWM method, the laminated composite plates and shells with delamination and transverse crack are simulated by the XLWM method, and the strain energy release rate (SERR) along the delamination front is calculated by the VCCT. The moving delamination front with an arbitrary and changing shape is traced by an algorithm presented by Xie and Biggers (2006), and delamination growth is predicted by a mixed-mode fracture criterion.},

abstract = {The development of a numerical procedure for the finite element analysis of anchors dynamically penetrating into saturated soils is outlined, highlighting its unique features and capabilities. The mechanical behaviour of saturated porous media is predicted using mixture theory. An algorithm is developed for frictional contact in terms of effective normal stress. The contact formulation is based on a mortar segment-to-segment scheme, which considers the interpolation functions of the contact elements to be of order N, thus overcoming a numerical deficiency of the so-called node-to-segment (NTS) contact algorithm. The nonlinear behaviour of the solid constituent is captured by the Modified Cam Clay soil model. The soil constitutive model is also adapted so as to incorporate the dependence of clay strength on strain rate. An appropriate energy-absorbing boundary is used to eliminate possible wave reflections from the artificial mesh boundaries. To illustrate the use of the proposed computational scheme, simulations of dynamically penetrating anchors are conducted. Results are presented and discussed for the installation phase followed by 'setup', i.e., pore pressure dissipation and soil consolidation. The results, in particular, reveal the effects of strain rate on the generation of excess pore pressure, bearing resistance and frictional forces. The setup analyses also illustrate the pattern in which pore pressures are dissipated within the soil domain after installation. Hole closure behind a dynamic projectile is also illustrated by an example.},

abstract = {Delamination is one of the undesired effects of machining using non appropriate cutting parameters or worn drill. Finite element modeling of drilling of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composites is an interesting tool for damage prediction. Recently, complete modeling of the process including the rotatory movement of the drill, penetration in the composite plate and element erosion has been developed in the scientific literature. Computational cost of these complex models is a great disadvantage when comparing them with simplified models that consider the drill acting like a punch that pierces the laminate. In this paper both complete and simplified models were developed and compared in terms of delamination prediction. The simplified model, presenting reduced computational cost, slightly overestimates the delamination factor when compared with the complex model. The influence on delamination of thrust force, clamping area at the bottom surface of the laminate and the stacking sequence is studied using the simplified model. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The American Ceramic Society The article describes an experimental investigation of oxidative degradation in mechanical performance of a SiC fiber-reinforced composite with a SiCN matrix produced by polymer infiltration and pyrolysis. Tensile stress rupture and retained strength tests were performed at 800°C in dry air and in water vapor. Fracture surfaces were examined to determine the degree of fiber pull-out and constituent oxidation and to measure radii of representative fiber fracture mirrors. The results indicate that degradation in tows adjacent to cut surfaces occurs equally rapidly in water vapor with or without application of stress; regions in the composite interior and near as-processed (uncut) surfaces appear far less affected. Similar effects are evident but less pronounced in dry air. Although oxidation of fiber coatings is observed in some cases, collectively the results suggest that fiber degradation is the main mechanism leading to reduced composite strength.},

abstract = {A shape of charge liners has a great effect on formation of a metal jet and its penetration into a target. In this paper, three different shapes of a charge liner, namely, conical, hemispherical and spherical-segment, are chosen to investigate their effect on damage response of a plate to underwater explosion. A Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) method based on mesh-free Lagrange formulation is applied to simulate an entire process of a shaped-charge detonation, formation of a metal jet as well as penetration on a steel plate. Initially, a SPH model of the shaped charge with a spherical-segment liner is developed, and its results are compared with experimental data to verify the effectiveness of this method. Then, numerical simulations of shaped charges with different liners are performed to study the damage characteristics of a steel plate subjected to underwater-explosion shock loading and the metal jet. It was found that for the shock wave the peak value of the radial pressure is larger than that of the axial pressure during the detonation process; the level of pressure in the spherical-segment case was higher than that of the other two cases. After the detonation, the metal jet was gradually produced under the effect of the detonation wave. Three types of the metal jet - a shaped charge jet (SCJ), a jetting projectile charge (JPC) and an explosive formed projectile (EFP) – were formed corresponding to three cases with conical, hemispherical and spherical-segment liners. The obtained results show that the velocity and length of the SCJ in the conical case are greater than that of the other cases, and it therefore may lead to a larger penetration depth. In addition, the EFP has a better motion stability for a velocity difference in the spherical case is lower than that of the other two cases. Subsequently, the shock wave arrives at the plate earlier than the metal jet, which will cause deformation of the plate. Due to higher pressure, the shock wave in the spherical-segment case has a stronger damaging effect on the plate than that in the other two cases. Finally, the metal jet reaches the plate causing a hole. Because of a wider jet head, the EFP results in a more serious damage to the plate. The suggested analysis and its results provide a reference for structural design of shaped charge warheads.},

The smoothed finite element method has become a powerful alternative to the finite element method as it promises to model large deformations and high mesh distortion without much loss of accuracy. In this manuscript, we present a comparative study of the finite element method, the smoothed finite element method and nodal stabilised reproducing kernel particle method with respect to their ability to predict impact events. The same constitutive models are applied for all computational methods. Through numerical examples, we show that meshfree methods can predict impact events most accurately but they are also computational more costly. We also show that the smoothed finite element method does not yield in an improvement compared to the finite element method. All results are compared to experimental data.},

abstract = {The ballistic impact response of thermoplastic-based composite armors made from Kevlar{\textregistered} fabric and polypropylene (PP) matrix has been investigated against ballistic test standard NIJ-STD 0106.01 Type IIIA. Kevlar{\textregistered} fabrics of different architectures, namely 2D plain woven, 3D orthogonal and 3D angle interlock fabrics, were produced and used as reinforcements to fabricate composite armor panels, using compression molding technology. Interfacial property between PP and Kevlar{\textregistered} was improved by adding a coupling agent called maleic anhydride grafted PP. Reduced density was observed in Kevlar{\textregistered} thermoplastic-based composites as compared to that of the thermoset-based laminates. Ballistic impact tests were imparted with 9 mm full metal jacket (FMJ) on armor panels having different fabric architecture. Ballistic test results revealed that 2D armor was 2.4-7{\%} more susceptible to damage than 3D armors. Hydrocode simulations were carried out using ANSYS AUTODYN v. 14.0 to obtain an estimate for the ballistic limit velocity and simulate failure modes. Post-impact damage patterns obtained from the simulations were compared with the experimental results to assess the performance of the simulations. Good correlation between the hydrocode simulations and experiments was found, both in terms of failure modes and damage patterns. 3D composite armors were able to confront the 9 mm FMJ projectile; however, the 2D plain woven armors failed. The increase in the ballistic limit from 2D plain woven armor to 3D orthogonal and 3D angle interlock armors was 16.44{\%} and 20{\%}, respectively, indicating the effect of fabric architecture.},

@article{Aktay2008,
abstract = {In this work several numerical techniques for modelling the transverse crush behaviour of honeycomb core materials were developed and compared with test data on aluminium and Nomex™ honeycomb. The methods included a detailed honeycomb micromechanics model, a homogenised material model suitable for use in FE code solid elements, and a homogenised discrete/finite element model used in a semi-adaptive numerical coupling (SAC) technique. The micromechanics model is shown to be suitable for honeycomb design, since it may be used to compute crush energy absorption for different honeycomb cell sizes, cell wall thicknesses and cell materials. However, the very fine meshes required make it unsuitable for analysis of large sandwich structures. The homogenised FE model may be used for such structures, but gives poor agreement when failure is due to core crushing. The SAC model is shown to be most appropriate for use in structural simulations with extensive compression core crushing failures, since the discrete particles are able to model the material compaction during local crushing. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {It is well known that laminated composite materials are prone to impact damage caused by foreign objects and exhibit poor damage resistance in through the thickness direction. By drawing inspiration from naturally occurring impact resistant structures, such as dactyl clubs of mantis shrimp, enhanced damage tolerance and impact energy absorption can be achieved with traditional CFRP layers by creatively arranging them into bio-inspired configurations, called helicoidal or Bouligand structures. Through an extensive numerical analyses of low velocity impact (LVI) supported by the experimental results, a further insight into the possibilities that these structures can offer in terms of damage resistance was attained. By comparing the results of three square plates with different planar sizes, it was shown that the helicoidal layups are more effective at absorbing energy while minimising through the thickness failure than standard quasi-isotropic and cross-ply laminates. Although the helicoidal composites generally exhibited a higher degree of delamination in LVI tests, the standard lamination schemes displayed higher degree of perforation, which resulted in a reduced residual strength in the compression after impact (CAI) testing of a quasi-isotropic laminate compared to several helicoidal ones subjected to 40 J and 80 J impact energy. Furthermore, using advanced finite element analysis (FEA) code LS-DYNA{\textregistered} for simulating LVI and CAI events, it was revealed that the helicoidal arrangement endured the least amount of fibre damage.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the fracture mechanics of micro-cracks in the laminated glass plates of car windshields. Foreign objects such small pieces of gravel impacting a car windshield can induce micro-cracks, which may propagate and lead to dangerous glass fracture events. A major issue is to identify the parameters controlling fracture propagation from the initial micro-crack to catastrophic macroscopic failure. The main conclusion of this study is that cyclic fatigue is not a controlling factor in crack propagation in impacted glass. A subcritical propagation effect, related to chemical reaction between SiO2glass and humidity, appears to be the main mechanism of crack propagation. An equivalent "stress intensity factor - time" power formalism is introduced to rationalize crack propagation endurance, for constant and variable cyclic stress conditions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The ballistic performance edge clamped 304 stainless-steel sandwich panels has been measured by impacting the plates at mid-span with a spherical steel projectile whose impact velocity ranged from 250 to 1300 m s-1. The sandwich plates comprised two identical face sheets and a pyramidal truss core: the diameter of the impacting spherical projectile was approximately half the 25 mm truss core cell size. The ballistic behavior has been compared with monolithic 304 stainless-steel plates of approximately equal areal mass and with high-strength aluminum alloy (6061-T6) sandwich panels of identical geometry. The ballistic performance is quantified in terms of the entry and exit projectile velocities while high-speed photography is used to investigate the dynamic deformation and failure mechanisms. The stainless-steel sandwich panels were found to have a much higher ballistic resistance than the 6061-T6 aluminum alloy panels on a per volume basis but the ballistic energy absorption of the aluminum structures was slightly higher on a per unit mass basis. The ballistic performance of the monolithic and sandwich panels is almost identical though the failure mechanics of these two types of structures are rather different. At high impact velocities, the monolithic plates fail by ductile hole enlargement. By contrast, only the proximal face sheet of the sandwich plate undergoes this type of failure. The distal face sheet fails by a petalling mode over the entire velocity range investigated here. Given the substantially higher blast resistance of sandwich plates compared to monolithic plates of equal mass, we conclude that sandwich plates display a potential to outperform monolithic plates in multi-functional applications that combine blast resistance and ballistic performance. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Experimental and numerical studies were conducted to determine the impact response of 15 mm thick AA2014-T652 forged plates in the velocity region from 800 m/s to 1300 m/s. Spherical projectiles (10 mm diameter) of hardened steel and soft iron were launched from propellant gun of 30 mm bore diameter and their impact and residual velocities were measured by capturing the impact phenomena with a high speed camera. Residual velocities of projectiles were in good agreement with Recht-Ipson analytical model, when kinetic energy of the fragments ejected from the target was accounted for in the energy balance. Failure in target plates occurred due to a combination of failure mechanisms such as hydrodynamic flow, spalling, ductile hole growth and scabbing. A comprehensive material characterization program was executed to study the plastic flow and failure of the material. Tensile tests were carried out on target and projectile materials at different stress triaxialities, strain rates and temperatures. The experimental data of stress-strain curves were used to calibrate the material parameters of Johnson-Cook constitutive model, which relates the flow stress of the material to effective plastic strain, strain rate and temperature. Fracture strain values were used to calibrate the material parameters of Johnson-Cook failure model, which relates the fracture strain of a material to stress triaxiality, strain rate and temperature. Finite element analyses of all the impact experiments were carried out using a two dimensional axisymmetric model. Numerical results overestimated the ballistic limit velocities as the quasi-brittle fracture of target could not be captured using Johnson-Cook failure model. Limitations of Johnson-Cook failure model were analyzed and numerical simulations were repeated using hydrostatic tensile stress failure model. A non-linear equation of state was also introduced in the model for more accurate calculations of hydrostatic stress. These modifications resulted in an excellent correlation between experimental and numerical results.},

abstract = {This paper presents some significant research results about velocity sensitivity of aluminum honeycomb under high-speed axial impact in a velocity range from 20 to 80 m/s. Series experiments were carried out with the help of self-developed high-speed impact system. Afterwards, corresponding numerical simulation works as well as some parametric studies were conducted. The resultant comparison told out that the plateau stress increases markedly when impact below 30 m/s, but slowly when impact at a velocity various from 30 to 80 m/s. Before the parametric studies, inertial effect in various impact masses was investigated. Comparison between parametric results showed that the promotion on Specific Load and energy-absorbing capability increases with the impact velocity for various honeycombs. Density also has a great influence on Specific Load. The higher honeycomb density is, the greater amplitude performs. The energy absorption diagram for honeycomb with different geometric configurations reveals the relationship between dynamic plane stress and energy per unit volume, and also proves the promotion with increasing of impact velocity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A series of small-scale internal blast experiments were conducted to assess the structural response and failure mechanisms of metal containers subjected to internal blast loading for the enhancement of Vulnerability/Lethality (V/L) modelling. The experiments examined welded steel containers, both fully enclosed and flanged, against a range of charge sizes detonated internally. The deformation and strain profiles of the containers were measured and compared with the numerical simulation results. The numerical simulations replicated the deformation and strains at the centre of the containers with a reasonable degree of accuracy. However, initial numerical simulations using shell elements significantly under-predicted strain values at the welded joints where failure of the containers occurred. Metallographic analysis of the welded joints and the high-speed imagery post-experiment indicated that failure occurred due to large strains in the heat affected zone and weld bead interface, where the material strength is reduced. To perform these assessments, a refined geometrical model, using Lagrangian elements, was required. Results from the numerical simulations highlighted that the quasi-static overpressure was the key parameter from the blast wave in determining the maximum deformation of the container, enabling simplified loading conditions for the Lagrangian analysis. Simulations using Lagrangian elements for the container improved the accuracy of the edge strain measurements but still under predicted the experimental results, which highlighted the inability of these models to account for weld defects such as porosity and lack of fusion which act as stress concentrators, assisting ultimate failure of welded containers.},

abstract = {Ballistic impact experiments were performed on triaxially braided polymer matrix composites to study the heat generated in the material due to projectile velocity and penetration damage. Quantifying the heat generation phenomenon is crucial for attaining a better understanding of composite behavior and failure under impact loading. The knowledge gained can also be used to improve physics-based models which can numerically simulate impact of composites. Triaxially braided (0/+60/-60) composite panels were manufactured with T700S standard modulus carbon fiber and two epoxy resins. The PR520 (toughened) and 3502 (untoughened) resin systems were used to make different panels to study the effects of resin properties on temperature rise. Ballistic impact tests were conducted on these composite panels using a gas gun, and different projectile velocities were applied to study the effect on the temperature results. Temperature contours were obtained from the rear surface of the panel during the test through a high speed, infrared (IR) thermal imaging system. The contours show that high temperatures were locally generated and more pronounced along the axial tows for the T700S/PR520 composite specimens; whereas, tests performed on T700S/3502 composite panels using similar impact velocities demonstrated a widespread area of lower temperature rises. Nondestructive, ultrasonic C-scan analyses were performed to observe and verify the failure patterns in the impacted panels. Overall, the impact experimentation showed temperatures exceeding 525 K (485°F) in both composites which is well above the respective glass transition temperatures for the polymer constituents. This expresses the need for further high strain rate testing and measurement of the temperature and deformation fields to fully understand the complex behavior and failure of the material in order to improve the confidence in designing aerospace components with these materials.},

Unlike other texts, this one takes the theory to a hands-on level by actually solving problems. It explains the concepts involved in the detailed analysis of composites, the mechanics needed to translate those concepts into a mathematical representation of the physical reality, and the solution of the resulting boundary value problems using the commercial finite element analysis software Abaqus. The first seven chapters provide material ideal for a one-semester course. Along with offering an introduction to finite element analysis for readers without prior knowledge of the finite element method (FEM), these chapters cover the elasticity and strength of laminates, buckling analysis, free edge stresses, computational micromechanics, and viscoelastic models and composites. Emphasizing hereditary phenomena, the book goes on to discuss continuum and discrete damage mechanics as well as delaminations. More than 50 fully developed examples are interspersed with the theory, more than 75 exercises are included at the end of each chapter, and more than 50 separate pieces of Abaqus pseudocode illustrate the solution of example problems. The author's website offers the relevant Abaqus and MATLAB{\textregistered} model files available for download, enabling readers to easily reproduce the examples and complete the exercises. The text also shows readers how to extend the capabilities of Abaqus via "user subroutines" and Python scripting.},

abstract = {A numerical study has been carried out to investigate the full flow path and aerodynamic characteristics of a hypersonic vehicle at a 7.0 free stream Mach number. Results indicate that the inlet started and unstarted operations have remarkable effects on the flow pattern of the full flow path. When the inlet operates in a started mode, the transverse pressure gradient generated by the forebody alters the air captured characteristics and the entering flow quality of the inlet. Furthermore, the expansion process of the nozzle jet flow is obviously affected by the external flow field around the afterbody with the cross section shape transiting from a near rectangle at the exit of the nozzle to a near triangle at the tail of the vehicle. When the inlet operates in an unstarted mode, the aerodynamic instability can be observed in the full flow path of the vehicle. Due to the oscillation of the external compressed shock wave and nozzle jet flow, the aerodynamic characteristics of the vehicle vary periodically with the lift-drag ratio changing from 0.25 to 2.09. Finally, by comparing to the experimental data, the reliability of the CFD is verified.},

abstract = {Composite laminates (CFRP, GFRP, and fiber metal composite laminates) are attractive for many applications (such as aerospace and aircraft structural components) due to their superior properties. Usually, mechanical drilling operation is an important final machining process for components made of composite laminates. However, composite laminates are regarded as hard-to-machine materials, which results in low drilling efficiency and undesirable drilling-induced delamination. Therefore, it is desirable to improve the cost-effectiveness of currently-available drilling processes and to develop more advanced drilling processes for composite laminates. Such improvement and development will benefit from a comprehensive literature review on drilling of composite laminates. This review paper summarizes an up-to-date progress in mechanical drilling of composite laminates reported in the literature. It covers drilling operations (including conventional drilling, grinding drilling, vibration-assisted twist drilling, and high speed drilling), drill bit geometry and materials, drilling-induced delamination and its suppressing approaches, thrust force, and tool wear. It is intended to help readers to obtain a comprehensive view on mechanical drilling of composite laminates. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Multiscale modeling provides a framework, based on fundamental principles, for constructing mathematical and computational models of such phenomena, by examining the connection between models at different scales. This book, by a leading contributor to the field, is the first to provide a unified treatment of the subject, covering, in a systematic way, the general principles of multiscale models, algorithms and analysis. After discussing the basic techniques and introducing the fundamental physical models, the author focuses on the two most typical applications of multiscale modeling: capturing macroscale behavior and resolving local events. The treatment is complemented by chapters that deal with more specific problems. Throughout, the author strikes a balance between precision and accessibility, providing sufficient detail to enable the reader to understand the underlying principles without allowing technicalities to get in the way.},

The validity of the present model is demonstrated by good agreement of comparisons between its predictions and results in the literature. The effect of various parameters such as impactor velocity, impactor radius, boundary conditions and thermal environment are investigated in detail.

abstract = {Localized damage and failure of composites often lead to spurious mesh dependence and zero energy dissipation due to the lack of a length scale by using finite element analysis. Based on the variational form of the stress boundary value problem with an interface discontinuity, this paper originally proposes a finite element model on the nonlocal intralaminar damage and interlaminar delamination of composite laminates. First, strain-based initial failure criteria and damage evolution criteria are used for the fiber and matrix, and the delamination is modeled by bilinear cohesive model. It is shown two length scales are introduced into the damage evolution behaviors of the fiber and matrix to solve the localization problem of composites. Second, the global nonlocal stiffness equation is derived including the nonlocal intralaminar consistent tangent stiffness and the cohesive interface stiffness, and the node forces for bulk and interface elements. Third, numerical algorithm and finite element codes are developed by combining ABAQUS-UMAT, UEL, USDFLD subroutines and UEXTERNALDB utility subroutine to implement the proposed model, where nonlocal averaging is performed on the derivatives of the equivalent strains with respect to the strain components during each load increment which are included in the nonlocal consistent tangent stiffness. Finally, damage evolution behaviors and load responses for two [0°/90°]4sT700/8911 composite specimens with different central hole sizes are studied by nonlocal FEA. Numerical results demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to address localized deformation, strain softening and strength prediction of composites effectively.},

abstract = {A long standing and very challenging problem is to predict the ultimate strength of a fibrous laminate under arbitrary load condition only based on the mechanical properties of its constituents measured independently. Although the Bridging Model is unique for calculating the internal stresses in the constituent fiber and resin (which stands for a matrix material throughout this paper) materials subjected to any load including a temperature variation, the in situ mechanical properties of the constituents must be provided beforehand. A unidirectional (UD) composite exhibits a transverse tensile strength smaller than the tensile strength of the monolithic resin material, indicating that the in situ tensile strength of the resin in the transverse direction is different from that measured using monolithic material specimens. This is attributed to a stress concentration. The stress concentration factors (SCFs) of the resin material in a RVE (representative volume element) due to occurrence of the fiber are determined in terms of elasticity theory. The resin in situ tensile, compressive, and shear strengths in the transverse plane are obtained by the corresponding resin strengths measured independently divided by the respective SCFs, whereas the resin in situ longitudinal strengths together with all the other constituent properties are the same as their original counterparts. Using these originally provided constituent properties as input data, the Bridging Model has been applied to analyze the second World-Wide Failure Exercise (WWFE-II) problems. The model's predictions for all the problems have been compared with available experimental data. Favorable correlation has been found. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The goal of this study is to analyze the effect of heat generation during plastic deformation in new sheet steel with high strength on the mechanical behavior during relaxation test $\sigma$ (t) {\{}divides{\}}$\epsilon$pand during tension at constant strain rate. In the first part an estimation of the fraction $\beta$ of plastic work converted into heat has been analyzed with and without phase transformation [Rosakis P, Rosakis AJ, Ravichandran G, Hodowany J. On the partition of plastic work into heat and stored energy in metals: Part II. Theory, Internal SM Report No. 98-8. California Institute of Technology, June 1998]. It is shown that $\beta$ increases with plastic deformation. The latent heat due to phase transformation plays an important role. In order to analyze those effects, a fast hydraulic machine has been used combined with an infrared technique allowing measurement of temperature increase with plastic deformation. This experiment has been performed in adiabatic conditions, over($\epsilon$, ̇) ≥ 10 s- 1. The value found for $\beta$ vary within the limits: 0.82 ≤ $\beta$ ≤ 1. In the second part the temperature effect due to plastic deformation has been analyzed via relaxation test. Due to high stress level and high ductility, relatively high temperature increase $\Delta$T was found in fast and quasi-static loading. The temperature effect is relatively important for the creep observed during testing. Such behavior is completely different in comparison to mild steel where the temperature increase is much lower [Rusinek A, Zaera R, Klepaczko JR, Cheriguene R.

The nonlinear shear behaviour of the composite was described by the Soutis shear stress-strain semi-empirical formula. The finite element (FE) method was employed to simulate the behaviour of the composite under low velocity impact. Interface cohesive elements were inserted between plies with appropriate mixed-mode damage laws to model delamination. The damage model was implemented in the FE code (Abaqus/Explicit) by a user-defined material subroutine (VUMAT). Numerical results in general gave a good agreement when compared to experimentally obtained curves of impact force and absorbed energy versus time. The various damage mechanisms introduced during the impact event were observed by non-destructive technique (NDT) X-ray radiography and were successfully captured numerically by the proposed damage evolution model. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The first part is concerned with a unidirectional elastic laminate subjected to uniform mechanical loads and to uniform changes in temperature. Both phases are assumed to be elastic, with temperature-dependent moduli and expansion coefficients; the solution reflects the influence of thermomechanical interactions. Exact solutions are not possible for any real system, because the local geometry is not known in detail. Instead, estimates of the fields are found from a modified Mori-Tanaka approximation. Examples are presented for two SiC/TiAlNb composites. Local stresses of interest are found after cooling from fabrication to room temperature. The presence of local yielding, and the influence of coupling terms on the local stress magnitudes are examined.

abstract = {Low-velocity impacts are unavoidable during the assembly stages and service life of aircrafts, marine and automobiles composite structures. This work aims to study the damage resistance of woven carbon fiber reinforced epoxy (CFRE) composite laminates subjected to a wide range of low-velocity impacts (15–85 J). The composite laminates were fabricated using prepreg technique. The impact tests were carried out using falling weight impact tester at room temperature (RT), 50 °C and 75 °C. The selected test temperature of 50 °C represents the summer midday temperature of some countries, while the highest temperature value (75 °C) was used to study the possible effects of unexpected temperature rise. Compression-after-impact (CAI) were undertaken to measure their residual strength. Specimens that were tested at low impact energies (15 and 35 J) as well as at higher temperature level (75 °C) are not penetrated by the impactor. Therefore, part of the kinetic energy is absorbed by the specimen in the form of damages. A second part is stored in the specimen as elastic energy, which is restituted back to the impactor for its rebound. Though no penetration is observed, the highest reduction in the stiffness and strength is observed at 75 °C. This is explained in terms of the softening and plastification of the epoxy matrix, the debonding at the interfacial fiber/matrix and the increase in the interfacial stress concentration of the re-solidified matrix. The threshold energy to initiate damage in the composite plates is measured/estimated using four methods and ranges between 2.8 and 9.6 J.},

abstract = {This paper presents an anisotropic damage model suitable for predicting failure and post-failure behavior in fiber-reinforced materials. In the model the plane stress formulation is used and the response of the undamaged material is assumed to be linearly elastic. The model is intended to predict behavior of elastic-brittle materials that show no significant plastic deformation before failure. Four different failure modes - fiber tension, fiber compression, matrix tension, and matrix compression - are considered and modeled separately. The onset of damage is predicted using Hashin's initiation criteria [Hashin Z, Rotem A. A fatigue failure criterion for fiber-reinforced materials. J Compos Mater 1973;7:448; Hashin Z. Failure criteria for unidirectional fiber composites. J Appl Mech 1980;47:329-34] and the progression of damage is controlled by a new damage evolution law, which is easy to implement in a finite element code. The evolution law is based on fracture energy dissipation during the damage process and the increase in damage is controlled by equivalent displacements. The issues related to numerical implementation, such as mesh sensitivity and convergence in the softening regime, are also addressed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The material properties are assumed to be temperature-dependent and graded in the thickness direction according to a simple power-law distribu-tion in terms of the volume fractions of the constituents. Numerical results for the dynamic response and vibration of the FGM plates with two cases of boundary conditions are obtained by the Galerkin method and fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. The results show the effects of geometrical parameters, material proper-ties, imperfections, temperature increment, elastic foundations, and boundary conditions on the nonlinear dynamic response and vibration of FGM plates.},

@article{Wei2013,
abstract = {In this study, we developed a finite element fluid-structure interaction model to understand the deformation and failure mechanisms of both monolithic and sandwich composite panels. A new failure criterion that includes strain-rate effects was formulated and implemented to simulate different damage modes in unidirectional glass fiber/matrix composites. The laminate model uses Hashin's fiber failure criterion and a modified Tsai-Wu matrix failure criterion. The composite moduli are degraded using five damage variables, which are updated in the post-failure regime by means of a linear softening law governed by an energy release criterion. A key feature in the formulation is the distinction between fiber rupture and pull-out by introducing a modified fracture toughness, which varies from a fiber tensile toughness to a matrix tensile toughness as a function of the ratio of longitudinal normal stress to effective shear stress. The delamination between laminas is modeled by a strain-rate sensitive cohesive law. In the case of sandwich panels, core compaction is modeled by a crushable foam plasticity model with volumetric hardening and strain-rate sensitivity. These constitutive descriptions were used to predict deformation histories, fiber/matrix damage patterns, and inter-lamina delamination, for both monolithic and sandwich composite panels subjected to underwater blast. The numerical predictions were compared with experimental observations. We demonstrate that the new rate dependent composite damage model captures the spatial distribution and magnitude of damage significantly more accurately than previously developed models. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A methodology is presented for evaluating a strain rate sensitivity parameter for plastic deformation of bulk metallic materials. It involves ballistic impact with a hard spherical projectile, followed by repeated FEM modelling, with predicted outcomes (displacement-time plots and/or residual indent shapes) being systematically compared with experiment. The “correct” parameter value is found by seeking to maximise the value of a “goodness of fit” parameter (g) characterizing the agreement between experimental and predicted outcomes. Input for the FEM model includes data characterizing the (temperature-dependent) quasi-static plasticity. Since the strain rate sensitivity is characterised by a single parameter value (C in the Johnson–Cook formulation), convergence on its optimum value is straightforward, although a parameter characterizing interfacial friction is also required. Using experimental data from (both work-hardened and annealed) copper samples, this procedure has been carried out and best-fit values of C (∼0.016 and ∼0.030) have been obtained. The strain rates operative during these experiments were ∼104–106s−1. Software packages allowing automated extraction of such values from sets of experimental data are currently under development.},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulations (LES) of turbulent hot jets emanating from realistic helicopter engine nozzle configurations at a Reynolds number of Re = 7.5 × 105and a Mach number of M=0.341 are conducted. The numerical method is based on hierarchically refined Cartesian meshes. The nozzle wall boundaries are resolved by a conservative cut-cell method. Three nozzle geometries of increasing complexity are considered, i.e., the flow fields of a clean geometry without any built-in components, a nozzle with a centerbody, and a nozzle with a centerbody plus struts are computed. The numerical method is validated by solutions for a single, a coaxial, and a chevron nozzle jet problem. A grid convergence study shows that the essential flow characteristics due to the intricacy of the nozzle geometry are well resolved. The results evidence that the flow field in the region 35 nozzle radii downstream of the exit is dominated by flow structures induced by the geometry. Compared to the clean geometry, the other two configurations show enhanced turbulent mixing. The centerbody and centerbody-plus-strut nozzle configurations reveal a spectral peak in the near nozzle exit region at St=0.15 which is caused by the wake flow of the centerbody.},

abstract = {Fibre–metal laminates (FMLs) are a new kind of hybrid composites, combining suitable properties of both fibre-reinforced composites and metal alloys, developed over the past three decades. Due to many advantages, such as light weight, high damage tolerance and good fatigue, corrosion and impact properties, FMLs have been effectively used for various applications, particularly in aerospace and aeronautical structures. Several categories of FML composites have been designed and manufactured to tailor specific properties and meet desired performance criteria. The most widely used FMLs are GLARE, ARALL and CARALL, which use glass, aramid and carbon fibres, respectively, reinforced in a polymer matrix along with aluminium as the metal layer. One of the primary loading types experienced by FMLs is different kinds of impact loading. Hence, understanding the characteristics and behaviour of various FMLs under impact will immensely contribute to the design and development of FML structures for use in various impact-related and allied applications. Impact loads produce complex stress–strain responses in FML composites, depending on the nature of the load, such as low-velocity, high-velocity and blast loading. Specifically, dynamic effects due to high strain rates induced and stress-wave propagation cause complex failure mechanisms, involving large-scale deformation, fracture and fragmentation. This chapter deals with the various parameters governing the behaviour of FML composites under different impact load cases. Relevant experimental studies and numerical simulations relating to different types of impacts and the associated responses of FML structures are categorically elaborated. A comparative study has been undertaken, wherever possible, highlighting the superiority of FMLs explicitly over conventional engineering materials. Furthermore, important aspects for optimising FML structures are also presented. This chapter provides a comprehensive summary of the commonly used FML composites and the key parameters affecting their impact properties and performances, including experimental results and numerical modelling. A comparison of properties and performance of various FMLs is also included. The information presented will be highly pertinent towards the development of novel, hybrid materials for applications in extreme, dynamic loading scenarios.},

FSW of thick plate leads to an extremely wide heat affected zone (HAZ). The microstructures within the weld zones were successfully modelled and simulated. However, the maximum loss of hardness in the HAZ resulted in only a 20{\%} reduction in the ballistic limit (V50). The maximum V50was associated with the highest level of hardness reached prior to a change in failure mechanism, from ductile hole enlargement, using an armour piercing (AP) projectile, or plugging with a fragment simulation projectile (FSP) to excessive spalling and associated adiabatic shear banding at too high hardness levels. The behaviour of the nugget zone has also been examined.

Fibre reinforced plastic polymer (FRP) composite materials have been used in the rehabilitation and replacement of the old degrading traditional structures or build new structures. However, the lack of design standards for civil infrastructure limits their structural applications. The majority of the existing applications have been designed based on the research and guidelines provided by the fibre composite manufacturers or based on the designer's experience. It has been a tendency that the final structure is generally over-designed. This paper provides a review on the available studies related to the design optimization of fibre composite structures used in civil engineering such as; plate, beam, box beam, sandwich panel, bridge girder, and bridge deck. Various optimization methods are presented and compared. In addition, the importance of using the appropriate optimization technique is discussed.

An exact displacement field which satisfies the boundary conditions on the outer and inner surfaces and stress continuity conditions at interfaces is presented. The nonlinear governing equations of motion for FML shallow spherical shells including the transverse shear deformation are established using the Hamilton's principle. The transient temperature is determined from the heat conduction equation by using the finite difference method. The collocation point method and Newmark method are adapted to solve the governing equations of motion numerically. The present model provides an effective method for nonlinear dynamic analysis of composites laminated structures with interfacial damage subjected to transient temperature fields. In the numerical examples, the transient temperature, thermal deformation and stresses of FML shallow spherical shells are presented. The transient temperature will increase from initial value with time to a steady state. The displacements and stresses of the shell increase with time and remain unchanged when the temperature is in a steady state. And the effects of interfacial damage on the mechanical behaviours of FML shallow spherical shells are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group Spin bowling plays a fundamental role within the game of cricket yet little is known about the initial ball kinematics in elite and pathway spin bowlers or their relationship to performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to record three-dimensional ball kinematics in a large and truly high level cohort of elite and pathway finger-spin (FS) and wrist-spin (WS) bowlers, identifying potential performance measures that can be subsequently used in future research. A 22-camera Vicon motion analysis system captured retro-reflective markers placed on the seam (static) and ball (dynamic) to quantify ball kinematics in 36 FS (12 elite and 24 pathway) and 20 WS (eight elite and 12 pathway) bowlers. Results indicated that FS bowlers delivered the ball with an increased axis of rotation elevation, while wrist-spin bowlers placed greater amounts of revolutions on the ball. It also highlighted that ball release (BR) velocity, revolutions and velocity/revolution index scores for both groups and seam stability for FS bowlers, and seam azimuth angle and spin axis elevation angle for WS bowlers, were discriminators of playing level. As such these variables could be used as indicators of performance (i.e. performance measures) in future research.},

abstract = {The present study investigates the afterburning from an explosion of a spherical 2,4,6-Tri-Nitro-Toluene (TNT) charge containing aluminum particles at four different Heights of Burst (HoB), to demonstrate that numerical simulations can facilitate the evaluation of the performance of Enhanced Blast eXplosives (EBX). The simulations are conducted using a two-phase Large Eddy Simulation model in Euler-Lagrange form, incorporating interaction between gaseous and solid phases by means of a two-way coupling. Finite rate Arrhenius chemistry is used to simulate the afterburning process, thereby enabling the examination of the separate heat-release contributions from carbon and aluminum afterburning reactions. The simulation results indicate the heat-release contribution from the aluminum reactions is significantly higher than from the carbon reactions, also does the heat-release from aluminum reactions, for all HoBs, fluctuate more in time compared to the heat-release from the carbon reaction. Most of the heat-release from carbon seems to occur at early times, after which the afterburning of carbon stagnates at a steady rate. The heat-release from aluminum reactions is more intermittent and is thought to be closely connected to the physical environment inside the mixing layer. Hence, the simulation results show that aluminum afterburning in EBX charges is strongly dependent on the mixing intensity, which is established by instabilities through shock-mixing layer interaction. Mixing intensity in its turn varies with HoB, as the shock propagation pattern is different for all HoB, indicating that in order to achieve maximum effect from aluminum inclusion to an explosive, HoB must be considered as a parameter.},

abstract = {In this study, the transient responses of a composite laminated plate and cylindrical shells subjected to low-velocity impacts were investigated numerically. The shear deformation theory of a doubly curved shell and von Karman's large deflection theory were used to develop a geometrically nonlinear finite element program. It is well-known that in the case of a flat plate with fixed boundary edges, a geometrically nonlinear analysis yields larger contact forces and smaller deflections than a corresponding linear analysis. However, in the case of cylindrical shells, an opposite result was found in this study; a geometrically nonlinear analysis exhibited smaller contact forces and larger deflections than a corresponding linear analysis. The reason for this opposite result is described in this study. Conversely, with a plate and shells that have the same size, shells with a larger curvature exhibited smaller deflections and larger contact forces. The strain distribution at the bottom surface of the plate/shells using the geometrically nonlinear analysis exhibited markedly or only marginally larger tensile areas than those produced using the linear analysis.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterize the quasi-static and dynamic behavior of composite materials and develop/expand failure theories to describe static and dynamic failure under multi-axial states of stress. A unidirectional carbon/epoxy material was investigated. Multi-axial experiments were conducted at three strain rates, quasi-static, intermediate and high, 10-4, 1 and 180-400s-1, respectively, using off-axis specimens to produce stress states combining transverse normal and in-plane shear stresses. A Hopkinson bar apparatus and off-axis specimens loaded in this system were used for multi-axial characterization of the material at high strain rates. Stress-strain curves were obtained at the three strain rates mentioned. The measured strengths were evaluated based on classical failure criteria, (maximum stress, maximum strain, Tsai-Hill, Tsai-Wu, and failure mode based and partially interactive criteria (Hashin-Rotem, Sun, and Daniel). The latter (NU theory) is primarily applicable to interfiber/interlaminar failure for stress states including transverse normal and in-plane shear stresses. The NU theory was expressed in terms of three subcriteria and presented as a single normalized (master) failure envelope including strain rate effects. The NU theory was shown to be in excellent agreement with experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Gruben2016,
abstract = {Low-velocity impact tests were performed on dual-phase and martensitic steel sheets and compared with corresponding quasi-static tests. The geometry and loading condition of the specimens were similar to formability tests, and the average strain rates before failure were in the range 80-210s-1for the low-velocity tests and 0.002-0.005s-1for the quasi-static tests. For both loading rates, the sheets failed under pre-dominant membrane loading, and by varying the specimen geometry, the stress states prior to failure ranged from uniaxial tension to equi-biaxial tension. Thus, the most important stress states occurring during an impact event in a thin-walled structure are covered. The experiments were complemented by nonlinear finite element simulations, where higher-order solid elements and a refined mesh were applied to capture the failure of the sheets. The materials were modelled using the Hershey high-exponent yield function combined with the associated flow rule and isotropic hardening. Quasi-static tensile and shear tests and tensile tests at elevated strain rates were performed to calibrate the constitutive relation. The results in terms of force-displacement curves and strain histories at critical positions in the specimens were similar for low-velocity and quasi-static loading, independent of material and specimen geometry. This indicates that the quasi-static test gives a good description of the sheet behaviour under low-velocity impact loading. The numerical simulations were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results, and strengthened the experimental finding that all the sheet-impact tests, except the martensitic steel sheet in a state close to equi-biaxial tension, displayed local necking before final fracture.},

abstract = {The combined effect of blast and impact loading against protective structures is still not fully understood. In this paper, the motivation is to investigate the combined effect of pressure and fragment loading on steel plates. To simplify the approach, it is assumed that the fragments strike and perforate the flexible target before the pressure load arrives. These perforations are idealized as pre-formed holes of generalized shapes in thin, ductile Docol 600DL steel plates, which are then subjected to controlled pressure pulses in the laboratory. The tests were carried out in a Pulse Pressure Loading Rig, and two different pressure levels were applied for each plate design. After the tests, the deflections caused by the pressure pulses were measured. Even though the plates were much deformed in some of the tests, no sign of failure was observed. Based on a number of material tests, the parameters in the modified Johnson-Cook constitutive relation were identified. Several sets of non-linear finite element simulations of the pressure loading process were then conducted. The agreement between standard Lagrangian simulations and the experimental results was in general good, but the simulations failed to give an accurate description of the deflection around the pre-formed holes. Fully coupled FSI simulations of the experimental tests were then carried out and these simulations demonstrate significant spatial variation of the pressure load. The FSI simulations also showed that this spatial variation of the pressure load influence the deflection profile, especially in the vicinity of the holes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Advanced composite materials are finding increasing application in aerospace, marine and many other industries due to the advantages in performance, structural efficiency and cost they provide. However, despite years of extensive research around the world, a complete and validated methodology for predicting the behaviour of composite structures including the effects of damage has not yet been fully achieved. The Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Composite Structures (CRC-ACS) is leading a currently running collaborative project to develop a methodology for determining mechanical behaviour and failure in composite structures. Key drivers of the project are the use of multi-axial testing machines for material characterisation and an appreciation of the issues involved due to the different length scales of any analysis. As part of the project, a critical review was performed to assess the state of the art in material constitutive modelling and composite failure theories. This paper summarises the results of the review, which includes a discussion of the various theories and approaches within the context of the dissipated energy density framework. The results of the review will be applied within the project to select appropriate constitutive modelling and failure approaches for implementation within a data-driven material characterisation methodology. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Impact induced delamination and matrix cracking have been used as failure criteria for the optimization of laminate. Fiber orientation, material and thickness in each lamina as well as number of lamina in the laminate have been used as design variables. Multi-objective approach has been used to achieve the optimum design of a laminate for combined normalized weighted cost and weight minimization. The results obtained from the integrated module show that IMPGA with FEM can lead to a global optimal solution for both single as well as multiple objective functions. It has been observed that better convergence of objective function could be obtained using IMPGA in comparison to sequential GA (SGA). Further, a significant reduction in computational time has been observed with IMPGA in comparison to SGA and the computational time decreases with increased number of processors. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Mechanical properties of structural steel at elevated temperatures are important for fire resistant design of steel structures. However, current design standards for fire resistance of steel structures are mainly based on the investigation of hot-rolled carbon steel with normal strength, such as mild steel. The performance of high strength steel at elevated temperatures is unknown. Hence, an experimental program has been carried out to investigate the mechanical properties of both high strength steel and mild steel at elevated temperatures. The high strength steel BISPLATE 80 ͑approximately equivalent to ASTM A 514, EN 10137-2 Grade S690Q, and JIS G 3128͒ and the mild steel XLERPLATE Grade 350 ͑approximately equivalent to ASTM 573-450͒ were tested using steady and transient-state test methods. The elastic moduli and yield strengths were obtained at different strain levels, and the ultimate strength and thermal elongation were evaluated at different temperatures. It is shown that the reduction factors of yield strength and elastic modulus of high strength steel and mild steel are quite similar for the temperature ranging from 22 to 540° C. The test results were compared with the predictions obtained from the American, Australian, British, and European standards.},

abstract = {The paper describes a procedure for estimating the material parameters of biological soft tissue by fitting model prediction to experimental load-deformation data. This procedure minimizes the error between data and theoretical model prediction through systematically adjusting the parameters in the latter. The procedure uses commercially available software and is not specific to any particular model; nevertheless, for illustration purposes, we employ a six parameter fibril-reinforced poroelastic cartilage model. We are able to estimate any and all of these parameters by the procedure. Convergence of the parameters and convergence of the arbitrary initial stress relaxation to the data was demonstrated in all cases. Though we illustrate the optimization procedure here for unconfined compression only, it can be adapted easily to other experimental configurations such as confined compression, indentation and tensile test. Furthermore, the procedure can be applied in other areas of biomechanics where material parameters need to be extracted from experimental data. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We investigated the ballistic resistance of hot-rolled structural steel plates with a nominal yield stress of 355 MPa in this study. Ballistic tests were conducted with 7.62 mm armor piercing bullets on monolithic and multi-layered configurations both in the as-received (AR) state and in a case-hardened (CH) state. In the CH state we made the surface stronger while preserving a relatively ductile core. This was done to improve the ballistic properties of the plates. Quasi-static uniaxial tension tests and Vickers hardness tests were conducted to calibrate constitutive models for numerical simulations. The ballistic tests revealed that the capacity was highest for a monolithic CH plate, and that case hardening increased the perforation resistance by more than 20{\%}. Plate layering decreased the capacity of the CH plates, while the capacity of the AR plates did not decrease consistently by increasing the number of layers. Finally, we used the hardness measurements to distribute material properties across the thickness of the CH plates. These distributed material properties were used in numerical models. Finite element simulations gave predominantly conservative results within 11{\%} of the experimental values.},

@article{Walter2007,
abstract = {Aerodynamic devices, such as wings, are used in higher levels of motorsport (Formula-1 etc.) to increase the contact force between the road and tyres (i.e. to generate downforce). This in turn increases the performance envelope of the race car. However the extra downforce increases aerodynamic drag which (apart from when braking) is generally detrimental to lap-times. The drag acts to slow the vehicle, and hinders the effect of available drive power and reduces fuel economy. Wings, in automotive use, are not constrained by the same parameters as aircraft, and thus higher angles of attack can be safely reached, although at a higher cost in drag. Variable geometry aerodynamic devices have been used in many forms of motorsport in the past offering the ability to change the relative values of downforce and drag. These have invariably been banned, generally due to safety reasons. The use of active aerodynamics is currently legal in both Formula SAE (engineering competition for university students to design, build and race an open-wheel race car) and production vehicles. A number of passenger car companies are beginning to incorporate active aerodynamic devices in their designs. In this research the effect of ground proximity on the lift, drag and moment coefficients of inverted, two-dimensional aerofoils was investigated. The purpose of the study was to examine the effect ground proximity on aerofoils post stall, in an effort to evaluate the use of active aerodynamics to increase the performance of a race car. The aerofoils were tested at angles of attack ranging from 0° – 135°. The tests were performed at a Reynolds number of 2.16 x 10 5 based on chord length. Forces were calculated via the use of pressure taps along the centreline of the aerofoils. The RMIT Industrial Wind Tunnel (IWT) was used for the testing. Normally 3m wide and 2m high, an extra contraction was installed and the section was reduced to form a width of 295mm. The wing was mounted between walls to simulate 2-D flow. The IWT was chosen as it would allow enough height to reduce blockage effect caused by the aerofoils when at high angles of incidence. The walls of the tunnel were pressure tapped to allow monitoring of the pressure gradient along the tunnel. The results show a delay in the stall of the aerofoils tested with reduced ground clearance. Two of the aerofoils tested showed a decrease in C l with decreasing ground clearance; the third showed an increase. The C d of the aerofoils post-stall decreased with reduced ground clearance. Decreasing ground clearance was found to reduce pitch moment variation of the aerofoils with varied angle of attack.},

Two high speed cameras were employed to record the impact events. Experimental results revealed an improvement in the ballistic limit, of up to 19.5{\%} for certain types of mBPRC, with respect to composites made with unidirectional fibres. Visual inspection of the impacted laminates revealed similar deformation mechanisms for composites reinforced with microbraids having different architectures and of different material. The slippage of the impactor through the layers of the laminates could have had detrimentally affected the ballistic properties of the manufactured composites. Modifications in the arrangement of the reinforcing phase are needed to fully exploit the potential of the microbraids in polymeric structures.},

The proposed system is achieved in three steps: Firstly, a mathematical model is prepared using the basic equations of motion. Second, An Ejection Mechanism of proposed warhead is explained with the help of schematics. Third, a part of numerical simulation which is done using the MATLAB software. The final result shows various ranges and times when split can be effectively achieved. With the new system, impact points are increased and hence it has a better probability of hitting a target.},

The experiments have been performed using a direct impact technique based on Hopkinson tube as a force measurement device. The tests covered a wide range of impact velocities. Both lubricated and dry conditions between specimen and projectile have been applied. Different failure modes for each case were found. For lubricated conditions a petalling was observed, whereas for dry conditions a radial neck along with a hole enlargement reduces the formation of petalling. The perforation process has been simulated by the application of 3D analysis using ABAQUS/Explicit FE code. The material behavior of the circular specimen was approximated by three different constitutive relations. The main task was to study the influence of the material definition on the response of the sheet specimen with special attention to the failure mode. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

Taking account of the lower contribution of the platelet-like filler to Young's modulus than that of the fiber-like filler, the modulus reduction factor (MRF) for the platelet-like fillers of 0.66, determined by fitting experimental data, is introduced into the above three equations. The aspect ratios of clay platelets in rubber-clay nanocomposites were determined by statistically analyzing TEM micrographs.

The numerical simulations of this problem have been performed using a finite element code, ABAQUS-Explicit with a fixed and an adaptive mesh for the plate. To define the thermoviscoplastic behaviour of the material constituting the plate, the Johnson-Cook model has been used. This homogeneous behaviour has been coupled with the Johnson-Cook fracture criterion to predict completely the perforation process. Three kinds of projectile shape (blunt, conical and hemispherical) have been simulated with a large range of impact velocities from 190 to 600 m/s. The analysis considers the influence of adiabatic shear bands, plastic work and the gradient of temperature generated in the plate. The numerical results predict correctly the behaviour projectile-plate in agreement with experimental data published by other authors. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

From the many parameters that affect the laminate response, several sets of assumptions differentiate the large number of models available in the literature. A few computational methods on the impact process are described. The paper focuses on analytical studies involving empirical, structural, and energy approaches. These models are critically reviewed and the scarcity of analytical studies on FMLs is revealed. The importance of the plate deformation during impact loading is emphasised and recommendations are given on the development of a quasi-static energy-balance model integrated into a structural theory. The generic nature of this method allows to understand the impact mechanics of FMLs. Further research is necessary in the assessment of complex structures in realistic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Standard carbon/epoxy tensile specimens were fabricated from unidirectional pre-impregnated material using two different manufacturing techniques that produced two different levels of surface roughness. Fiber volume fraction variation was computed by analyzing optical micrographs of the samples. During loading and unloading of the samples two-dimensional surface strain fields were measured on the specimen using digital image correlation. It was shown that in both cases the strain in the specimen is not uniform, as is generally assumed. Using finite element simulations the effects of fiber volume fraction variation and thickness variation were modeled individually and in combination. The simulations agree well with the experimental results and suggest that thickness variations are the dominant mechanisms involved in this elastic strain inhomogeneity.},

The aim of the present work is to introduce an explicit procedure in designing laminated composite plates for maximum buckling load subjected to strength and stiffness constraints using the polar formalism, which relates stiffness to the critical buckling load in order to simplify the calculation and optimization of the buckling load. The polar representation of plane elasticity is effectively used in this work in order to introduce a unified optimization method. Design for maximum flexural stiffness as well as laminate effective elastic modulus was developed in order to achieve the optimal orientation of the layers giving the maximum buckling strength. Three optimization procedures were proposed. The first one is unconstrained optimization and the two other cases are constrained optimization subjected to the flexural stiffness and the elastic modulus constraints. The quasi-homogeneous laminates, which have been used as a special class of laminate stacks, were proposed as the general solution for the optimal stacking sequence of the layers.},

The FMLs are based on various stacking configurations of aluminium alloy sheets and layers of woven glass fibre in a polypropylene matrix (GFPP) composite. Finite element models of the FMLs were created using the commercial software package Abaqus/Explicit, where the constitutive relationships and damage in the composite material were described through a user-defined subroutine. The composite was modelled as an orthotropically elastic material prior to damage initiation and the growth of subsequent damage was based on an instant failure rate-dependent model. The simulated deformation and failure modes in the FMLs were found to be in good agreement with published experimental data. For FMLs based on thin GFPP layers, a number of dynamic failure scenarios were captured, such as petalling, large tensile tearing and multiple debonding between the aluminium and GFPP layers. A high degree of correlation between simulated failure on the back face aluminium and the underlying GFPP damage modes was revealed. Finally, the transient behaviour of FML panels during blast loading was studied and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The load-carrying capacity of composite structures under water-based impulsive loads is studied in relation to different materials and loading conditions. The analysis focuses on the role of fiber orientation, fiber stiffness and angle of structure obliquity relative to load direction on the deformation and failure in monolithic carbon-fiber and glass-fiber/epoxy composite plates of similar mass and thickness. Structures are subjected to impulsive loads of different intensities generated using the Underwater Shock Loading Simulator (USLS), a novel projectile-impact-based impulsive loading facility. In-situ high-speed digital imaging is used to study the deformation and failure, focusing on the effects of load intensity, failure modes and material heterogeneity. The experiments are combined with fully dynamic 3D Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian (CEL) finite element simulations accounting for the effects of fluid-structure interactions (FSI) and in-ply and inter-ply cracking and failure. It is found that the carbon-fiber laminates provide higher blast resistance, but transmit a greater fraction of the incident impulse to the supports than the glass-fiber laminates. Damage through in-ply and inter-ply cracking in the carbon-fiber laminates is ∼25{\%} of that in the glass-fiber laminates. Higher angles of load obliquity trigger localized deformation at multiple locations, leading to more extensive in-ply damage and progressively shear-dominated rupture.},

Simulation of the penetration processes as well as the evaluation of energy and stresses distributions within the impact zones highlight the difference between normal and oblique ballistic impact phenomena. The findings show that the distributions of global kinetic, internal and total energy versus time are similar for normal and oblique impact. However, the interlaminar stresses at the ceramic-composite interface and the forces at the projectile-ceramic interface for oblique impact are found to be smaller than those for normal impact.

The source code is composed of a main program controlling the iterative procedure and five independent functions realizing input model preparation, FEA, mesh-independent filter and BESO algorithm. The code reads the initial design from a model database (.cae file) that can be of arbitrary 3D geometries generated in Abaqus/CAE or converted from various widely used CAD modelling packages. This well-structured code can be conveniently extended to various other topology optimization problems. As examples of easy modifications to the code, extensions to multiple load cases and nonlinearities are presented. This code is useful for researchers in the topology optimization field and for practicing engineers seeking automated conceptual design tools. With further extensions, the code could solve sophisticated 3D conceptual design problems in structural engineering, mechanical engineering and architecture practice. The complete code is given in the appendix section and can also be downloaded from the website: www.rmit.edu.au/research/cism/.},

This investigation presents the third part of paper series on composite materials based CNTs. Experimental characterization and numerical homogenizations were published in order to obtain effective elastic orthotropic properties. Therefore, the homogenized properties are used as input data for investigation of damage initiation and propagations in the specimens for Open Hole tensile tests. The numerical intralaminar damage model is created under ABAQUS software with Hashin's criteria. The model is formulated according to damage mechanics. The prediction of ply delamination in laminated composites containing CNTs is modeled by using interface elements. The numerical approach is based on the cohesive zone model, provides an efficient description of the delamination growth. The numerical study is performed in the quasi-static regime and an implicit finite element scheme is used. The force-displacement curves obtained numerically shows a good agreement with the experimental.},

abstract = {Fibre metal laminates, such as Arall or Glare, can offer improved properties compared to monolithic materials. Glare for example shows improved fatigue, residual strength, burn-through, impact and corrosion properties with respect to aluminium 2024, together with a considerable weight reduction and competitive costs. A large research program has proven the technological readiness of Glare and the fibre metal laminate has seen its application today in the primary structure of the Airbus A380 super jumbo. However, the effect of temperature on the performance of the fibre metal laminates has not been fully characterised. Differences in thermal expansion coefficients cause residual stresses after curing of the laminate. In service the temperature of the aircraft skin can vary between -55 up to 70 C due to solar radiation and convection, which will affect the thermal and mechanical properties of Glare. A detailed understanding of the behaviour of these laminates is necessary for further improvement of their performance and durability. With the increase in complexity of structures and material systems, the need for powerful design tools becomes evident. In this thesis, the thermo-mechanical behaviour of fibre metal laminates has been characterised via experimental testing and numerical modelling. Experimental tests have been performed to determine the temperature-dependent thermal and mechanical behaviour of unidirectional (UD) glass-fibre epoxy. Calculations based on these test results at room temperature and 80 C for the tension and shear stiffness of three different composite laminate lay-ups showed a good agreement with experimental test results. The UD glass-fibre epoxy data is used as input for the finite element model, together with aluminium 2024-T3 data from the literature. Glare laminates with a special lay-up have been experimentally tested to determine the effect of temperature and mechanical loadings on the laminate characteristics. The test results show that the off-axis and temperature effect can give a reduction of 24{\%} in ultimate strength at room temperature due to off-axis loading and a further reduction of 17{\%} at 80 C temperature. For standard Glare from the literature, where tests at elevated temperature have only been performed in fibre direction, the strength and stiffness reductions are at most 12{\%} compared to room temperature. Numerical simulation is a very powerful tool to investigate the behaviour of materials and structures. Therefore, a thermo-mechanical finite element model, based on a solid-like shell element and including thermal expansion and heat transfer, has been developed to capture the behaviour of Glare in a fully three-dimensional state. The through-the-thickness temperature and stress distributions can thereby be determined, which allows for a straight-forward implementation of damage and plasticity models. Moreover, the solid-like shell element is ideal for thin-walled (aerospace) structures since it can have high aspect ratios without showing Poisson thickness locking, which occurs in standard continuum elements, and can have multiple layers in one element. To account for physical nonlinearities, a strain hardening model for the aluminium 2024-T3 and an orthotropic damage model for the UD glass-fibre epoxy layers in Glare are used. The strain hardening behaviour of aluminium has been modelled with a yield function based on an isotropic Von Mises plasticity formulation. An exponentially saturating hardening law has been assumed, which gives a good agreement with the experimental aluminium 2024-T3 stress-strain curve. A return-mapping algorithm is used to project the stress back onto the yield surface when the stress state violates the loading condition. The concept of continuum damage mechanics is used, with a separate damage parameter for fibre and matrix, to describe the appearance of microcracks that lead to ultimate failure. The equivalent strain measure is obtained by rewriting the yield function of the orthotropic Hoffman plasticity model into a strain-based format. The damage parameters are directly implemented into the stiffness matrix to avoid undesirable coupling terms in the damage matrix. The simulations of the shear and tensile test in transverse direction show a good fit with the experimental curves for the UD glass-fibre epoxy. The transient behaviour is captured by taking the heat capacity, inertia forces and damping into account. Park's method is used to solve the dynamic system of equations. The good performance of the thermomechanical solid-like shell element and the transient solver have been demonstrated for a single element under thermo-mechanical loadings and the snap-through of a cylindrical panel subjected to a concentrated load. Via a number of benchmark tests for practical applications the obtained numerical model is compared with the experimental test results. Bluntnotch test simulations have been performed on Glare3-3/2-0.4 and on a special Glare laminate (tested at 0, 45, 67.5, and 90 off-axis angle), which show a good agreement with experimental results. Simulations of off-axis tensile tests on a 0/90 composite, tensile tests on standard Glare laminates, and off-axis tensile tests on special Glare laminates with additional fibre layers in -45 and 45 direction, also showed a good agreement with experimental results. The thermo-mechanical solid-like shell element and the experimentally obtained material data, presented in this thesis, together create a powerful simulation tool for the effective and accurate characterisation of fibre metal laminates under thermo-mechanical loadings.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. In the present study, oblique low-velocity impact (OLVI) on GLARE fiber-metal laminates (FMLs) has been modeled using finite element analysis (FEA) for the first time. Two types of boundary conditions (BCs) can be considered for impactor in the low-velocity impact: constrained (if the impact angle between the impactor and target remains constant during and after the contact) and free (if rotation of the impactor and change in angle with respect to the target is likely) BCs. The more details of these BCs are described in the paper. The OLVI is numerically modeled for four different impact angles. Effect of BC types and impact angle on energy absorption, as well as maximum contact force, is investigated. Due to lack of experimental results for the OLVI on FMLs in the open literature, the authors had to validate the present modelling via the experimental data of the perpendicular low-velocity impact. An excellent agreement was obtained between the numerical results and the experimental data. The results of present study reveal that at the same impact angle, the maximum contact force and energy absorption are greater for the constraint oblique impact (Constrained OLVI). In addition, in the Constrained OLVI, the maximum energy absorption occurs at larger impact angles, while this occurs at smaller impact angles for free oblique impact (Free OLVI). The conclusion to be drawn from all of the cases studied in this paper is that the maximum contact force occurs in the Constrained OLVI with smaller impact angles. Moreover, the maximum energy absorption takes place in the Constrained OLVI at higher impact angles.},

This paper reviews the various self-healing technologies currently being developed for fibre reinforced polymeric composite materials, most of which are bioinspired, inspired by observation of nature.

Three complex nozzles are a beveled nozzle, a nozzle with six chevrons and a six lobed ESTS nozzle.All nozzles have the same throat diameter and designed average exit Mach number. The studies are conducted at NPR = 6, using acetone PLIF, centerline pitot pressure measurements, and 3D RANS simulations. A novel method of decomposing PLIF images based on intensity histogram and then recomposing after applying selective gains to emphasize the growth of shear layers is discussed. PLIF images are processed to extract the growth rate of jet width which indicates the rate of mixing. The ESTS lobed nozzle shows the highest enhancement of mixing (430{\%}) followed by chevron (222{\%}) and the beveled nozzle with a moderate (138{\%}). The numerical simulations are validated and agree well with experimental results. ESTS lobed nozzle is found to produce widespread streamwise vortices compared to clustered vortices of the chevron nozzle. The mechanism of streamwise vorticity production from ESTS nozzle is clarified for the first time in this study.},

The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the accuracy and simplicity of presented analytical solution for stress analysis of plates with central cutout. The varying parameters, such as cutout shape and bluntness, load direction or cutout orientations, which affect the stress distributions and SCF in the perforated plates, are considered.

abstract = {Sensitivity analysis is a tool employed in engineering problems to identify the influence of input parameters on the state variables such as displacement, stress, strain and temperature. In the case of composite laminates the impact resistance depends on a number of parameters, which have been extensively studied by a number of researchers. But the reported work has thus far fallen short of providing the critical analysis on the order of degree of influence of the considered variables on the impact resistance of the composite laminates. In this work we present a sensitivity analysis approach to ascertain the degree of influence of various mechanical and material parameters on the impact performance of the composite laminated plates. Here we show that based on the normalized sensitivity coefficients, one can determine the influence of each individual parameter and hence identify the parameters, which need to be considered more critically in design. The normalized sensitivity coefficients hence give a numerical indicator of the factors having more influence on the impact resistance of the composite. This approach enables one to limit the number of material and geometric properties usually considered in design to the most critical ones for improving the low velocity impact behavior of the composite laminates. Our results indicate that the low velocity impact resistance of fiber reinforced polymer composite plates depends more significantly on the thickness and the stacking sequence and the effect of the elastic moduli of the fibers and matrix has less effect than the strength of the fiber and matrix materials of the composite. Initial numerical model was selected from the literature and the results verified against the available numerical and experimental results. The results show quite a good agreement with the experimental results. The results indicate that the impact performance depends significantly on the thickness and the stacking sequence and the effect of the elastic moduli of the fibers and matrix has less effect than the strength of the materials. These results will help in the further study to improve the impact resistance of the composite laminates as the focus should be more on the parameters like thickness, stacking sequence and materials having higher strengths. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Ahmed2007,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers. Mitigation of blast effects caused by accidental explosions is one of the major challenges in structural engineering. Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) sandwich panels offer promising systems for blast mitigation applications due to their considerable energy absorption compared to other materials with similar density. The FRP sandwich panels can have different inner core configurations that can be filled with other materials whenever needed. This paper numerically evaluates the effectiveness of new FRP honeycomb sandwich panels in resisting blast loads. A numerical model has been created using nonlinear explicit finite element simulation. Then, the model has been validated using the experimental field tests in the literature. Twelve FRP panels with different inner core configurations have been proposed to enhance the panels' performance by reducing their peak deformation and increasing their energy dissipation. The paper also investigates the effect of filling the FRP sandwich panels with sand on the panels' blast resistance. The analyses have shown that the FRP panels utilizing the new core configurations are able to dissipate more than twice the energy compared to the experimental panels with even less deformations. It has been found that using sand as a filling material provides a damping medium that enhances the panels' behavior under blast effect.},

The mechanisms behind the perforation process were studied depending on the projectile configuration used by analyzing the associated failure modes and post-mortem deflection. Secondly, a numerical study of the mechanical behaviour of aluminium alloy 2024-T351 under impact loading was conducted. To this end, a three-dimensional model was developed in the finite element solver ABAQUS/Explicit. This model combines Lagrangian elements with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) elements.

abstract = {Although many researches on the dynamic behavior of honeycombs have been reported, the strain rate effect of parent materials was frequently neglected, giving rise to the underestimated plateau stress and energy absorption (EA). In this paper, the strain rate effect of parent materials on the out-of-plane dynamic compression and EA of metallic honeycombs is evaluated by both numerical simulation and theoretical analysis. The numerical results show that the plateau stress and the EA increase significantly if the strain rate effect is considered. To account for the strain rate effect, a new theoretical model to evaluate the dynamic compressive plateau stress of metallic honeycombs is proposed by introducing the Cowper–Symonds relation into the shock theory. Predictions of the present model agree fairly well with the numerical results and existing experimental data. Based on the present model, the plateau stress is divided into three terms, namely static term, strain rate term, and inertia term, and thus the influences of each term can be analyzed quantitatively. According to the analysis, strain rate effect is much more important than inertia effect over a very wide range of impact velocity.},

abstract = {Potential applications of autonomous vehicles range from unmanned surveillance to search and rescue applications dangerous to human beings. Vehicles specifically designed for hover flight have their own possible applications, including the formation of high gain airborne phased antenna arrays. With this specific application in mind, the Cornell Autonomous Flying Vehicle (AFV) team sought to produce a four rotor hovering vehicle capable of eventual untethered acrobatic autonomous flights. The mechanical design of the AFV included both the selection of a battery-motorgearing- prop combination for efficient thrust production and the design of a lightweight yet sufficiently stiff vehicle structure. The components chosen were selected from the variety of brushless motors, battery technologies and cell configurations, and fixed pitch propellers suited to use in a four rotor hovering vehicle. The vehicle structure settled upon achieved a high degree of stiffness with minimal weight through the use of thin walled aluminum compression members supported by stranded steel cable. In addition to an efficient mechanical design, the vehicle also required onboard control and inertial navigation. In order to evaluate a variety of potential vehicle sensor, actuator, estimation, and control scenarios, a fully configurable nonlinear simulation of vehicle and sensor dynamics was also constructed. For the current iteration of the vehicle, a square root implementation of a Sigma Point Filter was used for estimation while a simple Linear Quadratic Regulator based on the nonlinear vehicle dynamics linearized about hover provided vehicle control. Sensory feedback on the current vehicle included an onboard inertial measurement unit and a human observer, to be eventually replaced by GPS or an indoor equivalent. While a hardware failure prevented the completion of a full range of tests, the team was able to complete a hands-free hover test that demonstrated the capabilities of the vehicle. Supplemented with various other final hardware tests, the vehicle demonstrated stable hover flight, potential vehicle endurance in the range of 10-15 minutes, and possible vertical acceleration of 0.8g beyond hover thrust. The final vehicle represented a significant achievement in terms of overall design and vehicle capability while future improvements will demonstrate more advanced nonlinear control algorithms and acrobatic flight maneuvers.},

Fiber/matrix debonding and ply to ply delamination, cracks matrix, rupture of fibers are addressed. Matrix and fiber are supposed to be brittle materials and follow a linear fracture model. Cohesive contact laws are implemented to model interfaces behavior for both debonding (fiber/matrix) and delamination (ply/ply). Piecewise linear elastic laws usually used in cohesive zone models are retained in this work. A Double Cantiliver Beam (DCB) test is first experimented using the present DEM with Cohesive Contact Models (CCM). Then, based on De Borst's works [1], a single fiber composite under transverse traction is modeled to study debonding and matrix cracks propagations depending on the matrix and the fiber/matrix interface strengths ratio. A bi-disperse medium for matrix and fiber is specifically elaborated to reduce the discrete elements number. The analysis is extended to a so-called multi-fibers composite specimen, also called Statistical Elementary Volume (SEV), made of several fibers embedded in the matrix. Finally, the results are compared with DeBorst's works and qualitatively discussed.},

A CFD-based optimization procedure, using the parabolized Navier-Stokes (PNS) equations, is used to design conical and contoured axisymmetric nozzles. The advantage of this procedure is that it accounts for viscosity during the design process; other processes make an approximated boundary-layer correction after an inviscid design is created. Results showed significant improvement in the nozzle thrust coefficient over that of the baseline case; however, the unusual nozzle design necessitates further investigation of the accuracy of the PNS equations for modeling expanding flows with thick laminar boundary layers.},

abstract = {In the field of automotive safety, the lightweight design of crash absorbers is an important research topic with a direct effect on the occupant safety levels. The design of these absorbers usually requires an optimization of their crashworthiness, which can include multi-objective and reliability-based optimization techniques. This process is very time-consuming, and in spite of the continuous growing of computational power, the problem needs a reliable solving scheme. The use of surrogate models and parallel computing are suitable alternatives to deal with this issue. However, the strongly non-linear response functions obtained from the finite element simulations need careful treatment. This work contributes with the application of a surrogate-based reliability-based design optimization method to an original design of a crash absorber made of metal and a glass-fiber reinforced polymer which is subjected to a frontal impact. Multi-adaptive regression splines models are employed to emulate the original responses, and three different approaches in the sampling stage of the method are compared. The absorbed energy and the mass of the element are considered as objective functions, while the peak value of the force transmitted to the occupants of the vehicle is the design constraint. A discussion of the employed materials is presented and the proposed approaches are compared. Finally, several Pareto fronts are obtained as a solution to the probabilistic problem. Results show that a combination of aluminum and glass fiber reinforced polymer is optimum for this problem, and some design rules are offered.},

A range of low velocity impact tests are conducted to study the impact resistance, considering the effects of impact energy, core thickness and impact site on the impact load, absorbed energy and failure modes. A user subroutine VUMAT is developed to model the composite face sheet behavior, in which a progressive damage model based on the Hashin failure criteria and Yeh delamination failure criteria is implemented in ABAQUS/Explicit. There is a generally good agreement between the experimental and predicted results in terms of impact force, absorbed energy, and failure modes of sandwich structures. These studies reveal that fiber damage, matrix damage and delamination of face sheets as well as buckling of core members occur under varied impact energies. The results provide insight into the low velocity impact behavior of such structures, and the knowledge of failure mechanisms could be useful for the development of novel lightweight multifunctional structures.},

An attempt has been made in this direction, in order to enhance mechanical and tribological properties of the composite materials. The latter, were achieved through the injection molding of high density polyethylene (HDPE) reinforced with specific volume fraction of CNTs. A considerable improvement on mechanical properties of the material can be observed when the volume fraction of CNT is increased. The composite reinforcement shows a good load transfer effect and interface link between CNT and HDPE. The volumetric wear rate is calculated from the Wang's model, Ratner's correlation and reciprocal of toughness. The results obtained clearly show the linear relationship with CNT loading which supports the microscopic wear model. It is concluded that both Halpin-Tsai and modified series model can be used to predict Young's modulus of CNT-HDPE composites. From thermal analysis study, it is found that melting point and oxidation temperature of the composites are not affected by the addition of CNTs, however its crystallinity seems to increase. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The boundary layer on the non-seam side, however, continues to undergo a laminar separation with no reattachment, thereby creating a lateral force in the direction of the seam, leading to CS. The onset of the CS regime is marked by intermittent formation of a laminar separation bubble (LSB) on the surface of the ball in the region between the laminar separation of the boundary layer and its reattachment at a downstream location. Owing to the varying azimuthal location of the seam, with respect to the front stagnation point on the ball, the transition via LSB formation is localized to a specific region over the seam side. In other regions, the boundary layer either transitions directly without the formation of an LSB, or separates on encountering the seam with no further reattachment. The spatial extent of the region where the flow directly transitions to a turbulent state increases with increase in {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}inline-graphic href="S0022112018004743{\_}inline5" mime-subtype="gif" type="simple"/{\textgreater} {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}{\$}Re{\$}{\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} {\textless}/alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} , while that of the LSB decreases. Interestingly, the flow dynamics is such that the magnitude of the swing force coefficient stays relatively constant with increase in {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}inline-graphic href="S0022112018004743{\_}inline6" mime-subtype="gif" type="simple"/{\textgreater} {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}{\$}Re{\$}{\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} {\textless}/alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} . With further increase in {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}inline-graphic href="S0022112018004743{\_}inline7" mime-subtype="gif" type="simple"/{\textgreater} {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}{\$}Re{\$}{\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} {\textless}/alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} , the boundary layer on the non-seam side undergoes a transition via formation of an LSB. This, along with an upstream shift of the separation point on the seam side, leads to a switch in the direction of the lateral force. It now acts away from the seam, and leads to RS. The transition from CS to RS occurs over a very narrow range of {\textless}inline-formula{\textgreater} {\textless}alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}inline-graphic href="S0022112018004743{\_}inline8" mime-subtype="gif" type="simple"/{\textgreater} {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}{\$}Re{\$}{\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} {\textless}/alternatives{\textgreater} {\textless}/inline-formula{\textgreater} wherein the flow intermittently switches between the two flow states. It is observed that the transition of the boundary layer on the seam side leads to an upstream shift of the separation point on the non-seam side at the onset of CS. A complementary effect is observed at the onset of RS. Experiments on a ball that is manually roughened bring out the relative effect of the seam and roughness on the transition of the boundary layer. Compared to a new ball, the magnitude of the maximum swing force coefficient for a rough ball is smaller during the CS regime, and larger during the RS regime. Unlike other models, the ball with roughened non-seam side and smooth seam side, for certain seam orientations, exhibits RS at relatively lower speeds and CS at higher speeds. The forces measured on the cricket ball are utilized to estimate the trajectory of the ball bowled at various initial speeds and seam angles. The lateral movement of the ball depends very significantly on the seam angle, surface roughness and speed of the ball at its delivery. The maximum lateral deviation of a new ball during RS is found to be less than half of that observed in CS. On the other hand, the lateral movement of a roughened ball during RS may significantly exceed its movement during CS. The range of the speed of the ball, for various seam orientations and surface roughnesses, are estimated wherein it undergoes CS, RS or one followed by the other. Optimal conditions are estimated for the desired lateral movement of the ball. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Both interfaces in the state after welding were characterized by wavy shape morphology with intermediate phases, which formed segmented structures. Two different morphologies consisted of equiaxed and columnar grains were observed within the Mg2Al3phase, while the Mg17Al12phase was built of only columnar grains. Furthermore, a small amount of Mg23Al30was detected by X-ray synchrotron diffraction. Annealing at 350 °C strongly induced the Mg23Al30phase development in the form of discontinuous layer between Mg2Al3and Mg17Al12phases after 10 h of annealing. Kinetics calculations indicated that, Mg2Al3phase growth at 300 °C was controlled by different mechanisms according to the location: volume diffusion and chemical reaction at the upper interface and solely by volume diffusion at lower one. The growth of Mg17Al12was governed only by volume diffusion. Furthermore, the same mechanisms were observed during annealing at 400 °C, however this heat treatment significantly changed the microstructure i.e. the grain size and shape. It was also established that the nanohardness of both Mg2Al3and Mg17Al12was about 350 HV.},

abstract = {The FEM simulations in the field of design and safety assessment represent very powerful tools, but they are strongly limited by available material models and material input data. If states near to ductile fracture are to be considered, more complex material description taking into account multiaxial loading conditions is necessary. As complex material models suitable to include these effects into practical simulations are still mostly phenomenological, experiments with samples of various geometries tested under various loading modes have to be used. On the basis of these tests a complex material behavior model covering elastic and plastic material behavior for various stress states can be obtained. This kind of the material behavior description allows a wide range of application from calculation of component limit loading conditions to material properties conversion for samples of different sizes e.g. This paper deals with ductile damage parameters determination for two typical Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) steels ferritic and austenitic. The ferritic steel is used for the RPV vessel and the austenitic one is used for internals. There are chosen appropriate samples geometries based on the preliminary FEM stress state analyses of samples at first. Subsequently, testing of proposed samples is performed and material parameters are evaluated. The obtained material plastic damage parameters are subsequently applied to FEM simulation of sharp notched samples and capabilities of applied models to describe material behavior for high stress concentrations is assessed on the basis comparison with real tests.},

abstract = {In 1989, Nurick and Martin published two review papers on the deformation of thin steel plates subjected to impulsive air-blast loading. The state of the art has progressed significantly in the following 25 years, and this review paper restricts itself to experimental studies that investigate the response of monolithic metal plates subjected to air-blast loading generated by detonating plastic explosive. From the large number of experiments reported, it is shown that the failure progressions in circular and quadrangular plates are similar and can be adequately described by three “failure modes” – namely large plastic deformation (mode I), tensile tearing (mode II) and shearing (mode III) although the severity and location of these failures on the plates is primarily determined by spatial distribution of the blast loading across the plate surface, and that boundary conditions significantly influence the onset of shearing and tearing failures due to variation in the in-plane movement of the plate material. The non-dimensional analysis approaches used by Nurick and Martin have been expanded to include the effects of load localisation and stand-off distance, and show good correlation with the expanded sets of test data published since 1989. It is concluded that these approaches still hold merit as simple tools for evaluating the likely effect of a close proximity air blast load on a flat metal plate.},

Finite element simulations have been performed using the continuum damage model, ODM-PMC, developed at Onera for 3D woven composites under static loadings. Through comparisons with the available experimental data, it has been demonstrated that the damage mechanisms are described correctly by the present model.

Here we demonstrate how using ice-templated structures, the concept of hierarchical design can be applied to conventional compounds such as alumina and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to make bulk hybrid materials that display exceptional toughness that can be nearly 300 times higher (in energy terms) than either of their constituents. These toughnesses far surpass what can be expected from a simple "rule of mixtures"; for a ∼80{\%} Al2O3-PMMA material, we achieve a KJcfracture toughness above 30 MPa m1/2at a tensile strength of ∼200 MPa. Indeed, in terms of specific strength and toughness, these properties for alumina-based ceramics are at best comparable to those of metallic aluminum alloys. The approach is flexible and can be readily translated to multiple material combinations.},

abstract = {Light metal sandwich panel structures with cellular cores have attracted interest for multifunctional applications which exploit their high bend strength and impact energy absorption. This concept has been explored here using a model 6061-T6 aluminum alloy system fabricated by friction stir weld joining extruded sandwich panels with a triangular corrugated core. Micro-hardness and miniature tensile coupon testing revealed that friction stir welding reduced the strength and ductility in the welds and a narrow heat affected zone on either side of the weld by approximately 30{\%}. Square, edge clamped sandwich panels and solid plates of equal mass per unit area were subjected to localized impulsive loading by the impact of explosively accelerated, water saturated, sand shells. The hydrodynamic load and impulse applied by the sand were gradually increased by reducing the stand-off distance between the test charge and panel surfaces. The sandwich panels suffered global bending and stretching, and localized core crushing. As the pressure applied by the sand increased, face sheet fracture by a combination of tensile stretching and shear-off occurred first at the two clamped edges of the panels that were parallel with the corrugation and weld direction. The plane of these fractures always lay within the heat affected zone of the longitudinal welds. For the most intensively loaded panels additional cracks occurred at the other clamped boundaries and in the center of the panel. To investigate the dynamic deformation and fracture processes, a particle-based method has been used to simulate the impulsive loading of the panels. This has been combined with a finite element analysis utilizing a modified Johnson-Cook constitutive relation and a Cockcroft-Latham fracture criterion that accounted for local variation in material properties. The fully coupled simulation approach enabled the relationships between the soil-explosive test charge design, panel geometry, spatially varying material properties and the panel's deformation and dynamic failure responses to be explored. This comprehensive study reveals the existence of a strong instability in the loading that results from changes in sand particle reflection during dynamic evolution of the panel's surface topology. Significant fluid-structure interaction effects are also discovered at the sample sides and corners due to changes of the sand reflection angle by the edge clamping system. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, fibers were etched from the panels and tensile tested to determine their strength distribution, interface properties were measured with fiber push-out tests, and the tensile properties of the matrix (without fiber) were also determined. From the measured constituent properties, the composite strength was predicted by using both global and local load-sharing (GLS and LLS) models, and these predictions were compared with the measured values. The composite strength was lower than predicted by Curtin's GLS model, but greater than predicted if it is assumed that the first fiber failure initiates composite failure (i.e. severe LLS). Metallographic examination of the fractured specimens revealed that the failure was consistent with a non-cumulative (localized damage) failure mode, which, as suggested by previous theoretical and experimental studies, is promoted by matrix plasticity. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.},

abstract = {Perforation of welded aluminum structures by small-arms bullets is studied both experimentally and numerically in this paper. From the chemical composition, artificial aging history, and welding procedure, the spatial distribution of the flow stress at ambient temperature of MIG-welded AA6082-T6 aluminum extrusions was determined by using a thermal finite element model and a nano-scale material model. The resulting flow-stress curves which are functions of the distance from the weld center line were used in a mechanical 3D finite element model to investigate the effect of the heat affected zone (HAZ) on the ballistic properties of welded aluminum extrusions. For experimental validation, 10 mm, 20 mm and 30 mm thick extruded profiles were processed and welded to correspond to the numerical method. Hardness measurements and ballistic impact experiments were performed in the weld metal, HAZ, and base material. Uniaxial tension tests were conducted for the base material of the 10 mm and 30 mm profiles. These tests provided sufficient data for experimental validation of the numerical method. Temperature distribution, hardness values, equivalent stress-strain curves, and ballistic limit curves are reported from both the experiments and the numerical simulations. In general, the experimental results correspond well with the numerical predictions and the predicted ballistic limit velocities are within 10{\%} of the experimental ones, suggesting that this method is a possible alternative to performing expensive and time consuming experimental testing in the early stages of the design of protective aluminum structures. The HAZ was found to impair the ballistic performance locally, but the difference between the ballistic limit for the base material and HAZ was never more than 10{\%} in this study.},

This study demonstrates the applicability of peridynamics to accurately predict nonlinear transient deformation and damage behavior of composites under shock or blast types of loadings due to explosions. The peridynamic predictions correlate well with the experimental results available in the literature. Therefore, peridynamics provides the ability to predict residual strength and durability for improving structural designs of composites under such loading conditions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2017. Recently, composite materials of a hybrid strategy are being developed to reduce the vulnerability of partial rupture failure. Simultaneously, the demand of a modelling method particularly for simulating the behavior of these materials is also emerging. This paper presents novel hybrid sprayed fiber-reinforced polymer composites containing carbon fiber cores developed for strengthening reinforced concrete structures, and a theoretical approach to model these materials. A micromechanical formulation that accounts for the hybrid characteristic of the composites was proposed to predict the overall performance of the composites. The derived model was then implemented into the nonlinear finite element codes to predict the structural behavior of the reinforced concrete beams retrofitted with the composites subjected to loading. A series of three-point bending tests of specimens were carried out to validate the predictability of the modeling technique. The obtained test results were comparatively explored with discussions of the theoretical approaches.},

abstract = {2024 Aluminum sheet and plate are known to have anisotropic strength characteristics with regard to plasticity. However, numerical investigations of the impact behavior of sheet metals rarely consider anisotropic behavior. The effect of anisotropy in an impacted 2024 aluminum target is investigated experimentally and numerically. Normal impact experiments of titanium alloy and tool steel projectiles, with impact velocities ranging from 190 to 299 m/s, into 3.175 mm thick 2024-T3 sheet and 12.7 mm thick 2024-T351 plate are presented. Rear surface strains and displacements are measured using three-dimensional digital image correlation (DIC). Simulations of selected impact experiments, using a six-component anisotropic plasticity model for the target, are compared to the experimental data. Two model parameter sets are used. The first set accounts for initial anisotropic strength properties of the target, while the second reduces to an isotropic (von Mises) yield function. The objective of the numerical simulations is to study the difference in the results between the anisotropic and isotropic parameter sets. Results show that the yield function parameters used for simulations of both the 3.175 mm sheet and 12.7 mm plate have a significant effect on the calculated residual velocity of the projectile. The anisotropic parameter set simulations agree with experimental rear surface panel displacements and strains for both target thicknesses. There is experimental evidence of anisotropic deformation behavior only in the case of the 3.175 mm thick 2024-T3 target panels. The results demonstrate that the form of the yield function has a significant effect on the results of the impact simulations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Three such projectiles used in this study were designated according to their front and second nose shapes as conico-blunt, blunt-blunt and blunt-conico. Each projectile was hit normally on 0.82 and 1.82 mm thick circular plate targets of 1100-H14 aluminium at different velocities. The deformation, failure mode and ballistic limit of both targets were obtained through experiments and reproduced through simulations using ABAQUS/Explicit finite element code. The ballistic limit of target was found to be highest against blunt-blunt followed by conico-blunt and blunt-conico projectile respectively. The results of target response thus obtained due to the impact of the double-nosed projectiles were compared with those of the single-nosed blunt and conical projectiles, and typical features of the plate response have been discussed for both double and single-nosed projectiles. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Hazzard2017,
abstract = {Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibre reinforced composite materials are widely used in ballistic impact and collision scenarios due to their extremely high specific strength and stiffness. Exceptional levels of protection are provided by controlling the damage and deformation mechanisms over several length scales. In this study, the role of UHMWPE fibre architecture (cross-ply, quasi-isotropic and rotational “helicoidal” layups) is considered on the damage and deformation mechanisms arising from low velocity impacts with 150 J impact energy and clamped boundary conditions. Dyneema{\textregistered}panels approximately 2.2 mm thick were impacted with a fully instrumented hemi-spherical impactor at velocities of 3.38 m/s. Full field deformation of the panels was captured through digital image correlation (DIC). The results indicate that the cross-ply laminate [0°/90°] had the largest back face deflection, whilst quasi-isotropic architectures restricted and reduced the central deflection by an average of 43{\%}. In the case of the [0°/90°] panel, the deformation mechanisms were dominated by large amounts of in-plane shear with limited load transfer from primary fibres. Conversely, the failure of the quasi-isotropic panels were dominated by large amounts of panel buckling over various length scales. The observed mechanisms of deformation with increasing length scale were; through thickness fibre compression, fibre micro-buckling, fibre re-orientation with large matrix deformation, lamina kink band formation, and laminate buckling. The helicoidal panels showed that bend-twist and extension-twist coupling were important factors in controlling clamped boundary conditions and the laminate buckling/wrinkling shape. Further examination of the impact zone indicated that the damage mechanisms appear to be fibre orientation dependent, with quasi-isotropic laminates having up to 37.5{\%} smaller impact damage zones compared with [0°/90°]. The experimental observations highlight the importance of fibre orientation in controlling the deformation mechanisms under dynamic impact, in particular limiting the shear deformation of Dyneema{\textregistered}panels.},

abstract = {The present paper outlines an unconventional energy based composite damage model capable of modelling woven and unidirectional composite materials. The damage model has been implemented into the LLNL-DYNA3D and LS-DYNA3D finite element codes for shell elements (plane stress), relevant to tensile, compressive and shear damage failure modes. The damage model uses five damage variables assigned to tensile, compressive and shear damage at a laminae level. The evolution of damage in each mode is controlled via a series of damage-strain equations, thus allowing the total energy dissipated for each damage mode to be controlled during a dynamic or impact event. The materials under investigation were a uni-directional (UD) carbon-epoxy and a woven carbon epoxy composite. Recent experimental test results from the CEC HICAS project have also been used to verify the behaviour of the model at elevated strain rates. Experimental data for the 0° and 90° tensile response indicates effectively rate independent, while matrix dominated modes, such as the shear response is highly rate dependent. The 0° and 90° tensile response and the tensile shear response have been modelled at a coupon level, including relevant strain rate effects, with the proposed damage model. Results show very good agreement with the available coupon experimental data. Suggestions are also presented for additional non-standard experimental tests to derive the material model parameters. A follow on paper describes the results of a series of simulations using the proposed material model on a number of experimental plate impact tests performed on the CEC HICAS project. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The results showed that the peak load was reduced by 61.54-64.69{\%} in sandwich panels with foam core compared to the mild steel plates without foam core. The effect of the interface between steel and aluminum foam as well as porous structure on the wave attenuation ability was characterized. The deformation mechanism of aluminum foam core was also discussed. It is clear that the energy was dissipated mainly by the formation and growth of cracks. Blast tests performed on the sandwich structure with different aluminum foam core densities indicated that the ratio of the peak load incident to the sandwich structure and the peak load transmitted from the sandwich structure increased as the decrease of foam core density. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the mechanical behaviour of the aluminium alloy 2024-T3. This alloy has particular relevance since it is widely used in the aeronautical industry for building aircraft structures. The deformation behaviour of this material has been characterised in tension under wide ranges of strain rate and temperature. Among the aluminium alloys, the AA 2024-T3 highlights due to its high flow stress and strain hardening. Moreover, the material temperature sensitivity has been found dependent on plastic strain. The Modified RusinekKlepaczko constitutive description [Rusinek A, Rodr{\'{i}}guez-Mart{\'{i}}nez JA, Arias A. A thermo-viscoplastic constitutive model for FCC metals with application to OFHC copper. Int. J. Mech. Sci. 52 (2010) 120135], which takes into account such dependence of the temperature sensitivity on plastic strain, has been applied for modelling the thermo-viscoplastic response of the material. Satisfactory agreement between experiments and analytical predictions provided by the Modified RusinekKlepaczko model has been found. In order to study the material behaviour under impact loading, low velocity perforation tests on AA 2024-T3 sheets have been performed at different initial temperatures using a drop weight tower. Plastic instabilities formation and progression are identified as the cause behind the target collapse for all the impact tests conducted. The results from these perforation tests are compared with those reported in [Rodr{\'{i}}guez- Mart{\'{i}}nez JA, Pesci R, Rusinek A, Arias A, Zaera R, Pedroche DA. Thermo-mechanical behaviour of TRIP 1000 steel sheets subjected to low velocity perforation by conical projectiles at different temperatures. Int. J. Solids Struct. 47 (2010) 12681284.] for TRIP 1000 steel sheets. The comparison reveals that the amount of specific energy absorbed by the aluminium targets is much lower than that corresponding to the steel targets. The role played by inertia on delaying plastic instabilities formation is determined as potential responsible for such behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A statistical analysis of explosive blast loading field (test) data has revealed a high level of variability of peak reflected pressure, impulse and time of positive phase duration for repeatable tests where variability would be expected to be a minimum. The model error (accuracy) of a widely used predictive blast load model is also assessed. A probabilistic model of blast loading is then developed that considers variability and/or uncertainty of explosive mass, net equivalent quantity of an explosive in terms of TNT mass, stand-off distance, air temperature, air pressure, inherent variability and model error. Two widely used explosives are considered: Tritonal (military) and ANFO (terrorism). This type of statistical and probabilistic analysis is essential for structural reliability analysis of structures subject to explosive blast loading where load variability is an important contributor to damage and safety risks. It was found that the TM5-1300 design values for peak reflected pressure and time of positive phase duration adequately represent median values of the probability distribution of blast loads. The TM5-1300 design values for peak reflected impulse were 40{\%} higher than median values with probabilities of exceedance of only 4{\%} to 23{\%}. This over-estimation of actual blast loads on a structure may lead to conservative design outcomes.},

Also, nonloaded plates were tested under high-velocity impact. The impact and residual velocity were measured in all tests. From the relationships between the impact and residual velocities, the ballistic limit was estimated by a least-squares method. No significant differences were found between the ballistic limits under the two loaded conditions. Above the ballistic limit in the preloaded plates, unstable cracks that can generate the catastrophic failure of the plate were observed. At similar velocities, this phenomenon was not observed in nonloaded plates. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2016. Fiber-reinforced composites are a well-recognized option for repair and rehabilitation of the pipelines for the oil and gas industry. Infilled composite sleeve system provides an effective rehabilitation solution, where the sleeve acts as prime reinforcement without any direct contact with steel. However, the long-term performance of the repair is dependent, in part, on the effect of hygrothermal ageing of the composites. In this publication, glass transition temperature and mechanical properties are compared for glass-fiber reinforced vinyl ester composite, both as-manufactured and after hot-wet conditioning at 80℃. The tensile and shear strength reduced substantially during conditioning, whilst the elastic modulus was relatively stable. The average glass transition temperature of the composite dropped from the as-manufactured value of 110℃ to 97℃ and 101℃, after 1000 and 3000 h of conditioning, respectively, indicating that it is stable and that the composite is suitable for use as a pipeline repair material operating at 80℃. The results indicate that a 1000 h conditioning period, specified as a minimum period in ISO/TS 24817 is suitable for representing long-term properties for stiffness-based designs for the composite material and conditioning temperature investigated.},

abstract = {The large-deflection behavior of the clamped stiffened plates subjected to confined blast load is investigated through experimental tests, theoretical calculation and numerical simulation in this paper. The blast load in confined space lasts longer and has more complex form compared to the shock waves from an open space explosion. The influence of elastic-plastic effect on the dynamic response of blast loaded plate should be taken into account in theoretical prediction of permanent displacement. Besides, evident yield lines, which could change the deformed shape of the plates, can be always found around the clamped edges and the diagonals of plates. The global deformation of a plate cannot be represented by a simple shape function of a smooth surface. In this paper, a series of experimental tests of square stiffened plates under confined blast load was conducted. Based on experimental observation and assumed-modes, an elastic-plastic analytical model for blast loaded stiffened plates is presented, in which the effects of yield line pattern and elastic-plastic deformation are considered. The Lagrange motion equation that contains the total strain energy, potential energy and kinetic energy of stiffened plates and blast load system is established and solved. Numerical simulations are performed to investigate the influence of strain rate effect of material and boundary conditions on the dynamic responses of stiffened plates. By comparing the numerical results, the rationality of hypothetic conditions employed in analytical model is verified. The classical rigid-plastic and elastic-plastic methods were also used to calculate the dynamic response and permanent displacements of test specimens. The comparison results showed that the theoretical calculation model presented in this paper is feasible and of high precision and practicability.},

abstract = {Impact, damage evolution and penetration of thick-section composites are investigated using explicit finite element (FE) analysis. A full 3D FE model of impact on thick-section composites is developed. The analysis includes initiation and progressive damage of the composite during impact and penetration over a wide range of impact velocities, i.e., from 50 m/s to 1000 m/s. Low velocity impact damage is modeled using a set of computational parameters determined through parametric simulation of quasi-static punch shear experiments. At intermediate and high impact velocities, complete penetration of the composite plate is predicted with higher residual velocities than experiments. This observation revealed that the penetration-erosion phenomenology is a function of post-damage material softening parameters, strain rate dependent parameters and erosion strain parameters. With the correct choice of these parameters, the finite element model accurately correlates with ballistic impact experiments. The validated FE model is then used to generate the time history of projectile velocity, displacement and penetration resistance force. Based on the experimental and computational results, the impact and penetration process is divided into two phases, i.e., short time Phase I - shock compression, and long time Phase II - penetration. Detailed damage and penetration mechanisms during these phases are presented. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Among the key challenges present in the modelling and optimisation of composite structures against impact is the computational expense involved in setting up accurate simulations of the impact event and then performing the iterations required to optimise the designs. It is of more interest to find good designs given the limitations of the resources and time available rather than the best possible design. In this paper, low cost but sufficiently accurate finite element (FE) models were generated in LS Dyna for several experimentally characterised materials by semi-automating the modelling process and using existing material models. These models were then used by an optimisation algorithm to generate new hybrid offspring, leading to minimum weight and/or cost designs from a selection of isotropic metals, polymers and orthotropic fibre-reinforced laminates that countered a specified impact threat. Experimental validation of the optimal designs thus identified was then successfully carried out using a single stage gas gun. With sufficient computational hardware, the techniques developed in this pilot study can further utilise fine meshes, equations of state and sophisticated material models, so that optimal hybrid systems can be identified from a wide range of materials, designs and threats. {\textcopyright} 2009 Dr M.

abstract = {A series of experiments are carried out to explore the impact characteristics of stiffened plates struck by the sub-ordnance velocity projectiles. Considering the relative position of impact point to the nearest stiffeners on target, six kinds of representative target plates with different stiffened styles are specially designed. Altogether sixteen target plates, respectively without, single- and cross-stiffened are tested and compared. Two kinds of projectiles, one with spherical nose and the other with truncated oval nose, are fired using a 25 mm refitted cannon. The initial velocities of projectiles range from 244 to 430 m/s. Experimental results show that the penetration process is greatly dependent on the nose shapes of projectiles. The tumbling of truncated oval-nosed projectiles is very prominent, which results in the great uncertainty of deformation and failure mode of target plates. While the spherical-nosed projectiles keep much more stable, plugging and ductile hole enlargement are the most distinct failure modes. In the end, some empirical formulas aimed at blunt-nosed projectiles are proposed, which could be helpful for the design of the protection structures. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examines how layers of elastic and visco-elastic materials may be assembled to mitigate these features. The impedance mismatch between two elastic layers is known to reduce the pressure, but dissipation is required to mitigate the transmitted impulse in light-weight armor. A novel design concept called impact or blast tuning is introduced in which a multi-layered armor is used to tune the stress waves resulting from an impact or blast to specific frequencies that match the damping frequencies of visco-elastic layers. The material and geometrical parameters controlling the viscous dissipation of the energy within the armor are identified for a simplified one-dimensional system, to provide insight into how the optimal design of multi-use armor might be based on this concept.},

Some composite shells such as composite plates and hemispheres with different layer-uppinghave been investigated using LS-DYNA software. The blast loading is simulated by explosion's pressure versus time curves and is directly defined in LS-DYNA software. The Tsai-Wu failure criterion is used to predict the behavior of the composite structure.In this paper, the effect of layer-upping on the blast resistance of the structure is investigated. The results show that, hemisphere composite has better performance against the blast loading than plate and failure occur under greater load. Also it is shown that angle ply composite structures has good resistance in comparison with cross plies one.},

The multiplicity of the scales of the operating mechanisms is discussed and clarified by taking examples of damage in a unidirectional ceramic matrix composite and in a cross ply polymer matrix composite laminate. Two multi-scale modeling strategies––the hierarchical and the synergistic––are reviewed in the context of deformational response. Finally, the “big picture” as it relates to the cost-effective manufacturing of composite structures intended for long-term performance is outlined and desired future direction in multi-scale modeling is discussed.},

In case of complex and big construction systems subjected to the arbitrary loads, including a complex boundary conditions, solving of differential equations by analytical methods is almost impossible. Then the solution is application of numerical methods. One of the basic numerical methods is Finite Difference Method (FDM) based on replacing of differential equations with corresponding difference equations. Using of this method, the prob-lem come to solving of system of paired algebraic equations, making the problem more easier for solving.

The proposed analytical model consists of a homogenization method, a failure criterion, and a damaged stiffness model. An improved failure prediction algorithm is presented, which tends to enhance the prediction of ultimate strengths. It is shown that assuming a final failure of undulated yarns for a failure of 90{\%} of subdivisions rather than 100{\%}, alongside assigning a multi-failure mode for the failed subdivision rather than single failure mode is yielding much better results. The predicted elastic properties and ultimate strengths are compared to available experimental and numerical data, where a very good agreement is shown.

The DGEBA-based networks cured with aromatic amines had higher yield stresses than related networks cured with aliphatic amines, due to differences in the rigidity of the backbone. In each series, the yield stress was also found to rise with increased crosslinking. This may be caused by the increased constraint of the crosslinks on the molecular segments involved in the yielding process. The Eyring equation was found to satisfactorily describe the dependence of the yield stress on the strain rate. Surprisingly, the calculated volume of the flow unit was independent of both the crosslink density and the nature of the amine.},

The application of these mathematical expressions to the finite element discretized medium allow one to obtain a general spatial and directional expression for the characteristic length which guarantees the objectivity of the results with respect to the size of the finite element mesh.

abstract = {Cylinder casing filled with explosive under asymmetric initiation is an easy way to increase the warhead efficiency. The radial distribution of fragment velocity is an important design parameter for the asymmetrically initiated warhead. Available formulas either can only apply to calculating fragment velocity of certain radial direction, or their applications need experiments to determine unknown parameters. Establishment of a new math model to calculate velocity distribution was presented in this paper. Firstly, in the central section of warhead cylinder (treated as 2D problem), a stationary point was proposed existing between the asymmetric initiation point and the warhead center. From this stationary point the warhead can be radially cut into many segments of explosive and fragments. Then the ratios of charge mass to casing mass of those segments were computed, corrected and used to obtain fragments velocities by Gurney formula. Most importantly, the position of the stationary point was theoretically determined by the one-dimensional detonation pushing piston theory (Zhang etal., 2001) [14]. The math model established in the present work was finally validated with the numerical modeling and the experiment results. The results indicate that the model can accurately compute the radial distribution of fragment velocity of asymmetrically initiated warhead and is completely theoretically enclosed, needing no experiments to determine unknown parameters. In addition, the fragment velocity distribution gotten from experiments was found to be different with the theoretical velocity distribution near the initiation side because of influence of the initiator volume.},

As an example, a summary of a comprehensive methodology developed at the University of Maryland for the assessment of damage to composite structures under high explosive blast pressure loading is provided. A simplified methodology is then introduced to obtain structural responses at various blast wave pressure loadings and predict structural collapse based on these responses. The results of numerical tests on flat laminated composite panels show that this simplified methodology, which does not require computationally expensive failure analysis including the progressive material damages, can predict structural failure with reasonable accuracy. Accordingly, the methodology could be used as a first screening tool for design study, and then a full analysis including material damage and failure could be conducted in order to provide detailed predictions of local damage to the selected designs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Woodhead Publishing Limited.

@article{Lopes2009,
abstract = {Low-velocity impact events occur with some frequency on composite applications such as airplane components. From ground operations to unavoidable birds, there is a range of situations where an aircraft outer component may be subjected to unexpected impact loads. In most cases, such as tool dropping, the impactor has a relatively high mass but low-velocity. The damage produced in such cases is mostly in the form of delaminations which are not easily noticeable through routine naked eye inspections. However, the spread of these delaminations over wide areas of the structure may severely compromise the residual compressive strength of the structure, possible even below the limit load for which it was initially designed. Therefore, the ability to predict the impact damage resultant from impact events likely to happen is of utmost importance in the aeronautical industry. Traditionally, impact damage models rely on either analytical calculations or extensive experimental data. By one side, analytical predictions of the impact damage resistance and tolerance of composite laminates are overly simplified and unreliable. On the other side, testing each promising design is time consuming and costly. Low-cost virtual testing by means of nonlinear finite element analyses can replace most of the actual impact testing of laminates. Once the dynamics of the impact phenomena and the damage mechanisms are correctly simulated, progressive failure analyses can be a valuable tool in the accurate prediction of impact damage resistance of composites. In this research, a reliable virtual tool for the numerical simulation of the impact damage on composite laminates is proposed. A continuum material model for the simulation of intraply damage phenomena is implemented in a numerical scheme as a user subroutine of the commercially available Abaqus finite element package. Delaminations are simulated by making use of cohesive elements. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2009 by Claudio Lopes.},

Fibre (E-glass fibre) and matrix (vinylester resin) damage and degradation of individual unidirectional composite laminas are modelled using the Hashin failure model. The delamination between composite laminates is captured by three-dimensional bilinear cohesive elements. A thin elastomer (polyurea) layer is applied to the back face of the panel to reduce damage to the composite laminates. The predicted deformation histories, evolutions of fibre/matrix damage patterns, and inter-lamina delamination are captured and compared between monolithic and hybrid elastomer/composite panels. The model reveals the important role of the elastomer layer in improving panel performance by effectively mitigating the transmitted impulse to the back face of the panel and reducing delamination, while maintaining overall stiffness.},

abstract = {Natural materials and structures are increasingly becoming a source of inspiration for the design novel of engineering systems. In this context, the structure of fish skin, made of an intricate arrangement of flexible plates growing out of the dermis of a majority of fish, can be of particular interest for materials such as protective layers or flexible electronics. To better understand the mechanics of these composite shells, we introduce here a general computational framework that aims at establishing a relationship between their structure and their overall mechanical response. Taking advantage of the periodicity of the scale arrangement, it is shown that a representative periodic cell can be introduced as the basic element to carry out a homogenization procedure based on the Hill-Mendel condition. The proposed procedure is applied to the specific case of the fish skin structure of the Morone saxatilis, using a computational finite element approach. Our numerical study shows that fish skin possesses a highly anisotropic response, with a softer bending stiffness in the longitudinal direction of the fish. This softer response arises from significant scale rotations during bending, which induce a stiffening of the response under large bending curvature. Interestingly, this mechanism can be suppressed or magnified by tuning the rotational stiffness of the scale-dermis attachment but is not activated in the lateral direction. These results are not only valuable to the engineering design of flexible and protective shells, but also have implications on the mechanics of fish swimming. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper describes recent progress in materials modelling and numerical simulation of the impact response of fibre-reinforced composite structures. A continuum damage-mechanics (CDM) model for fabric-reinforced composites is developed as a framework within which both in-ply and delamination failure may be modelled during impact loading. Damage-development equations are derived and appropriate materials parameters determined from experiments. The CDM model for in-plane failure has been implemented in a commercial explicit finite element (FE) code, and new techniques are used to model the laminate as a stack of shell elements tied by contact interface conditions. This approach allows the interlaminar layers to be modelled and strength reduction due to delamination to be represented; it also provides a computationally efficient method for the analysis of large-scale structural parts. The code is applied to predict the response of carbon-fabric-reinforced epoxy plates impacted at different velocities by a steel impactor. A comparison of structural response and failure modes from numerical simulations and impact tests is given which shows a good agreement for the prediction of delamination damage at low impact energies and fracture and penetration at higher impact energies. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

While the detail formulation of the MAT162 material model can be found in the Keyword user's manual [1], the main objective of this paper is to describe a methodology to determine a set of softening parameters using a unit single element analysis. The analytical formulation of post-yield damage softening is presented with stress-strain behavior of a single element under different loading conditions. Since MAT162 uses four different softening parameters, i.e., AM1 and AM2 for fiber damage along material directions 1 and 2, AM3 for fiber shear and crush, and AM4 for matrix crack and delamination; the choice of a set of these four AM values is not obvious. The stress-strain plots presented in this paper will serve as an additional user guide to select a set of AM values for a specific material and a specific application. Unlike linear-elastic design of composite structures with max-stress/strain or quadratic failure theories, modeling the post-yield softening behavior allows one to simulate the energy absorbing capabilities of a composite structure. It is important to choose a set of AM values which represent a material's behavior through single element analyses and validation of the model with other quasi-static and dynamic experiments. A poor choice of the AM values may lead to prediction of either higher or lower energy absorption capabilities of the composite structure. In order to accomplish this objective, the single element analysis is presented with appropriate loading and boundary conditions. Model validation studies simulating static and dynamic experiments can be found in [2], and further studies will be presented elsewhere},

abstract = {Drilling is a key factor in the manufacturing of holes required for the assemblies of composite laminates in aerospace industry. The quality of holes can be controlled by the choice of tool geometry and process parameters. Simulation of drilling process is an effective method in optimizing the drill geometry and process parameters in order to improve hole quality and reduce the drill wear. In this research, we have developed three-dimensional finite element model for drilling carbon fiber-reinforced. A three-dimensional progressive intra-laminar failure model based on the Hashin's theory is considered. Also, an inter-laminar delamination model which includes the onset and growth of delamination by using cohesive contact zone was developed. It is shown that the induced thrust force, torque, damaged area and delamination are predicted very well with the given drill geometry and process parameters. The delamination area resulted from drilling of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer was predicted successfully using the developed model. The current finite element model using three-dimensional elements and improved damage models showed much better capability in simulation of the drilling process of CFC compared to the previous model using shell elements. },

High strain rate experiments were conducted on a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB), on balanced symmetric laminates from which the stress, strain and strain rate histories within the laminates were recovered. Strain rates of the order of 1000/s were achieved in the specimen. A 3-D viscoplasticity model was used to describe the high strain rate response of the composite. A computer code was written to incorporate the constitutive equations into the finite element code ABAQUS, which was subsequently used to analyze the dynamic response of the composite specimen in the high strain rate SHPB experiment. Comparison of the analysis result with experimental data indicates that the viscoplasticity model determined using low strain rate testing can still be valid for modeling the high strain rate responses.},

In this study, a new pattern of composited filling structure— honeycomb cells filled with circular tubes (HFCT) has been put forward. Comprehensive experimental investigations have been conducted in terms of ten types of HFCT structures with hollow and different fillers including circular carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) tubes as well as circular Al tubes in different filling patterns. Detailed mechanical performances on energy absorption, deformation mode and interaction between inside circular CFRP filler and outside hexagonal honeycomb container were determined. The analyses show that, when undergoing axial loading, the HFCT structure not only maintains the same excellent mechanical properties with conventional hollow honeycomb core, but also gains evident promotion in energy absorption when filled in appropriate filling pattern. Obvious filling effect and matching effect were extensively discussed around the kind patterns of filling structures, which have significant influence on HFCT structure's performance. All the achievements prove that the HFCT structure can be considered as a perfect choice in aid to design of energy absorption device.},

abstract = {Young's modulus of unidirectional glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites for wind energy applications were studied using analytical, numerical and experimental methods. In order to explore the effect of fiber orientation angle on the Young's modulus of composites, from the basic theory of elastic mechanics, a procedure which can be applied to evaluate the elastic stiffness matrix of GFRP composite as an analytical function of fiber orientation angle (from 0 to 90), was developed. At the same time, different finite element models with inclined glass fiber were developed via the ABAQUS Scripting Interface. Results indicate that Young's modulus of the composites strongly depends on the fiber orientation angles. A U-shaped dependency of the Young's modulus of composites on the inclined angle of fiber is found, which agree well with the experimental results. The shear modulus is found to have significant effect on the composites' Young's modulus, too. The effect of volume content of glass fiber on the Young's modulus of composites was investigated. Results indicate the relation between them is nearly linear. The results of the investigation are expected to provide some design guideline for the microstructural optimization of the glass fiber reinforced composites. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

When conducting computer simulations using a micromechanics approach, experimental tensile, compressive, and shear data are needed for constitutive modeling of the resin matrix material. The material properties of an Epon E862 epoxy resin will be investigated because it is a commercial 176°C (350°F) cure resin currently being used in these aircraft engines. These properties will be measured using optical measurement techniques. The epoxy specimens will be tested in tension, compression and torsional loadings under various strain rates ranging from 10-5 to 10-1 s-1 and temperatures ranging from room temperature to 80°C. To test the specimens at high temperatures, a specialized clear temperature chamber was used. The results show that the test procedure developed can accurately and quickly categorize the material response characteristics of an epoxy resin. In addition, the results display clear strain rate and temperature dependencies in the material response. {\textcopyright} 2008 ASCE.},

abstract = {This article presents the results of a series of blast tests on a carbon fiber-reinforced poly-ether-imide (PEI) and a glass fiber-reinforced PEI composite. Initially, the fracture properties of the two composite systems were characterized through a series of flexural and interlaminar fracture tests. Blast testing was then undertaken on a ballistic pendulum facility, capable of measuring the impulse imparted by the plastic explosive. Delamination, localized fiber buckling, fiber fracture, and shear failure at the boundary of the clamped plates were identified as the primary failure mechanisms in the laminates, with their severity depending on the panel thickness and the applied impulse. Delamination was very localized along the center plane of the laminate, a reflection of the very high interlaminar fracture toughness of these composites. The critical impulse for rear surface fiber fracture has been found to increase rapidly with laminate thickness for the range of panels considered here. The impulses associated with the onset of rear-surface fiber fracture and complete failure of the target were similar, suggesting that rear surface fiber fracture is a pre-cursor to complete failure in these laminates. Limited tests on the glass fiber-reinforced PEI system showed that it offers a superior blast resistance to its carbon fiber counterpart. {\textcopyright} SAGE Publications 2008.},

Post-mortem examination of the plates indicated that damage and failure occurred by bulging, lateral indentation, and side and front petaling. A theoretical model based on a membrane representation was developed that analyzed the impact by dividing the process into five stages. This model underpredicted the ballistic limit by up to 14{\%}, with better correlation found at higher yaw angles. Excellent agreement was observed between the experimental and analytical final velocities when the data points were corrected to reflect the difference between the experimental values of the ballistic limit and that predicted by the model.

abstract = {Utilizing shock compression physics considerations and explicit numerical techniques a methodology has been developed to design composite personnel armor by optimizing the role each layer plays during projectile defeat. The initial design consists of a very hard 1st layer to deform and fracture the projectile, an orthotropic 2nd layer to slow down the shock wave propagation in the through thickness direction, whilst allowing rapid propagation in the transverse directions, a 3rd porous layer to absorb the shock wave energy through PV-work, and a 4th layer to provide confinement for the porous medium. Based on the above armor protection concept, composite plates comprising of alumina (Al2O3) Ceramic, Dyneema{\textregistered}HB25 and porous polyurethane (PU) foam were constructed to test against baseline armor AISI 4140 steel plate. A hypothetical orthotropic material model closely resembling that of Dyneema HB25 was derived based on fundamental materials relations as well as limited available literature information. Material models for the other materials used in this research were based on existing sources. An integral experiment was conducted to validate this composite armor against numerical simulations. Through this study, the composite armor has been shown experimentally to be more effective in resisting penetration than a steel plate of equivalent (and slightly greater) areal density, and that the material layering sequence is fundamentally correct, while the numerical modeling has provided a general guidance to the behavior of the system. This research was done to explore this kind of approach to armor design to evaluate its merit. We make no claim that this design is ready for field use. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper, we propose to implement, in the framework of a commercial finite element software, a computational multilevel finite element method for the modeling of composite materials and structures. In the present approach, the unknown constitutive relationship at the macroscale is obtained by solving a local finite element problem at the microscale. The main advantages of the proposed computational approach are that it can greatly save computer memory and CPU time, and it has good accuracy at the same time while it allows to easily building nonlinear behavior for high order mechanical theories to deal with problems which cannot be handled by classical multiscale or homogenization theories. The linear and the non-linear cases are introduced and implemented in ABAQUS. A Python script and user-defined FORTRAN subroutines have been developed for this purpose. Finally numerical results show that the method presented in this paper is effective and reliable. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Capturing the matrix behavior under multi-axial stress states is concluded to be essential to accurately predict the composite material behavior, even when considering simple load cases such as transverse compression and/or shear. Without any calibration procedure at the composite level, good agreement with the experimental data is observed for different loading conditions, including strain-rate dependency.Using this validated micro-scale model, a three-dimensional simulation of the formation of a kink band under longitudinal compression of the composite is conducted. A new evidence at micro-scale is found supporting the hypothesis that shear stresses transferred between fibers and matrix are particularly important in the formation of the kink band.},

@book{Karlos2013,
abstract = {Over the last decades considerable attention has been raised on the behaviour of engineering structures under blast or impact loading. The use of explosives by terrorist groups around the world that target civilian buildings and other structures is becoming a growing problem in modern societies. Explosive devices have become smaller in size and more powerful than some years ago, leading to increased mobility of the explosive material and larger range effects. Usually the casualties from such a detonation are not only related to instant fatalities as a consequence of the direct release of energy, but mainly to structural failures that might occur and could result in extensive life loss. Famous examples of such cases are the bombing attacks at the World Trade Center in 1993 and on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995. In both of these incidents, structural failure, including glass breakage, resulted in far more victims and injuries than the blast wave itself. After the events of the 11th September 2001 that led to the collapse of the World Trade Center in New York it was realized that civilian and government buildings, as well as areas with high people concentration (metro and train stations, means of mass transportation, stadiums etc.) are becoming potential bombing targets of terrorist groups. Since most engineering structures are vulnerable to such type of loading scenarios, a guide should be introduced to the designer in order to guarantee structural integrity even under those extreme situations.},

The potential of this simulation approach for correctly predicting the through-thickness distribution of internal damage was specifically examined in the study. The constitutive models for intralaminar and interlaminar damage modes were incorporated into the ABAQUS/Explicit FE code by user-defined VUMAT material subroutines. The results of numerical simulations were compared with experimental data obtained by drop-weight impact testing and stereoscopic X-radiography. The developed FE model provided a correct prediction of the structural impact response of laminated samples over the range of impact energies examined and successfully simulated the temporal sequence of the major damage mechanisms. A reasonably good agreement was also achieved between numerical predictions and experimental observations in terms of shapes, orientations and sizes of individual delaminations induced by impact at the different interfaces. Additional numerical analyses were also conducted to investigate the influence of simulated intralaminar damage modes on the prediction of interface delaminations. The analyses show that implementation of intralaminar damage modes may be required for accurate simulation of the three dimensional delamination pattern induced by impact. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Second, an exponential form damage evolution law combined with characteristic length based fracture energy approach has been presented. Stiffness degradation is characterized by a variable determined by the equivalent displacement for each failure mode. Third, an experimentally verified strain rate model that considers the rate dependency of the strength and modulus of the composite laminate is considered. Fourth, cohesive elements are inserted at every inter-layer for modeling the delamination evolution. Fifth, the constitutive model has been combined with an element erosion algorithm for the removal of highly distorted elements. Simulations have been performed using reduced integration hexahedra elements (RIHE) and full integration hexahedra elements (FIHE). Implementation of cohesive elements exhibited better delamination progression. Experimentally verified strain rate model enhanced the efficiency of the model showing good correlation between the present simulations and experimental observations, in terms of damage patterns, residual velocity, kinetic energy and ballistic limit.},

TeXtreme{\textregistered} plain weave plies were used with two different thicknesses, 0.08 mm and 0.16 mm (referenced as ultra-thin-ply and thin-ply, respectively), and tested under different load levels. Load-displacement curves were analyzed and the extent of damage was inspected using optical microscopy and ultrasonic technique. The results showed that the damage onset occurs earlier in thin-ply laminates. The damage onset in thin-ply laminates is matrix cracking which induces delaminations, whereas for ultra-thin-ply laminates is due to delaminations which are induced by shear forces and small amount of matrix cracking. Moreover, the fiber breakage appears earlier in ultra-thin-ply laminates.},

Limitations of continuum representations of intra-ply damage and the effect of mesh orientation on the analysis predictions are discussed. It is shown that accurate prediction of matrix crack paths and stress redistribution after cracking requires a mesh aligned with the fiber orientation. Based on these results, an aligned mesh is proposed for analysis of the open-hole tension specimens consisting of different meshes within the individual plies, such that the element edges are aligned with the ply fiber direction. The modeling approach is assessed by comparison of analysis predictions to experimental data for specimen configurations in which failure is dominated by complex interactions between matrix cracks and delaminations. It is shown that the different failure mechanisms observed in the tests are well predicted. In addition, the modeling approach is demonstrated to predict proper trends in the effect of scaling on strength and failure mechanisms of quasi-isotropic open-hole tension laminates.},

abstract = {For competitors in the shooting sports, gun recoil can affect performance and create discomfort. An objective method of measuring felt recoil forces would be useful to evaluate methods of recoil reduction. An experimental test apparatus was developed to measure recoil forces of sporting rifles and shotguns. No modifications to the firearms themselves were necessary to make the measurements. Through both inertial and dissipative restraint mechanisms, the apparatus reproduced gun movement that was representative of that experienced by a particular shooter. This should result in measured recoil forces similar to those experienced by the shooter. The apparatus measures the horizontal shoulder force and the vertical force component exerted at the stock comb. The recoil event was found to be quite short, having duration on the order of 10 ms. Peak recoil forces for common shotgun target loads were in the range of 1.6-2.2 kN (360-494 lbf). The apparatus was found sensitive enough to measure recoil force differences among different factory loaded ammunition, and differences in recoil force imparted by different firearms shooting the same ammunition. The apparatus should prove useful for quantifying differences in felt recoil as affected by ammunition type, gunstock geometry, barrel porting, recoil reduction devices, and gun weight, among other factors. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

All-PP tapes are highly oriented and their failure behaviour follows that of other highly oriented polymers. All-PP woven composites fail ultimately due to PP tape failure. However, this failure mode is accompanied by delamination of fabrics in the woven structure. Consolidation pressure plays a decisive role in controlling the interlaminar properties and hence the delamination resistance and furthermore the fatigue limit of the composite. Comparison of all-PP woven composites with commercial alternatives based on glass and natural fibres reveals the excellent relative performance of all-PP composites under fatigue loads. Fatigue properties of all-PP composites are however sensitive to the testing temperature, and elevated temperatures can lead to a rapid reduction of the fatigue resistance of these all-polymer systems.},

abstract = {Woven silicon carbide fiber-reinforced, silicon carbide matrix composites are leading candidate materials for an advanced jet engine combustor liner application. Although the use temperature in the hot region for this application is expected to exceed 1200 ?C, a potential life-limiting concern for this composite system exists at intermediate temperatures (800?200 ?C), where sig- nificant time-dependent strength degradation has been observed under stress-rupture loading. A number of factors control the degree of stress-rupture strength degradation, the major factor being the nature of the interphase separating the fiber and the matrix. BN interphases are superior to carbon interphases due to the slower oxidation kinetics of BN. A model for the intermediate temperature stress-rupture of SiC/BN/SiC composites is presented based on the observed mechanistic process that leads to strength degradation for the simple case of through-thickness matrix cracks. The approach taken has much in common with that used by Curtin and coworkers, for two different composite systems. The predictions of the model are in good agreement with the rupture data for stress-rupture of both precracked and as-produced composites. Also, three approaches that dramatically improve the intermediate temperature stress-rupture properties are described: Si-doped BN, fiber spreading, and ‘‘outside debonding''. {\#} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Simulation of ballistic impact generally falls into one of two categories: analytical models which assume certain dominant physical phenomena and numerical simulations, where the general continuum conservation equations are integrated in time at all points in a spatial mesh to obtain the spatial time history of stresses, strains, velocities, etc., in the projectile and target. Analytical formulations model the mechanical processes over the full field of influence which leads to approximate conservation equations for the entire region in an impact event. These for mulations have met with considerable success so long as the assumptions inherent in the model are applicable. Numerical simulations (hydrocodes) compute the wave (shock) interactions important at early times. Mechanical effects, e.g. plugging, erosion, etc., require realistic constitutive modeling which includes failure criteria and failure propagation. This paper gives a broad overview of both analytical and hydrocode modeling and examines the technical issues, uncertainties and potential diffuculties for advancement in predictive capability.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Laminates with different thicknesses are impacted by drop-weight test machine under different impact energies. The time histories of impact force are recorded and ultrasonic C-scan technology is used to inspect the internal damage of the laminates. Numerical simulation is conducted using finite element method (FEM), taking into account both intralaminar and interlaminar damage. The intralaminar damage model is based on the continuum damage mechanics (CDM) approach, which consists of the strain-based Hashin failure criteria and the exponential damage evolution law, and considers the nonlinear shear behaviour of the material. The interlaminar damage is simulated by interface elements with cohesive zone model. The numerical results show good agreements with the experiments, thus verifying the validity of the presented numerical model. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

abstract = {This chapter presents a model that describes the deformation and failure processes of multilayered hybrid composites in a state of plane stress. The model, which is considered as a structural-phenomenological one, is a coupled deformation/failure model (DFM). According to the model, except for two common states of the composite laminate-the initial state (monolithic material) and the final state (completely broken material)-there exists a group of intermediate states: the material with cracks. Within the group, there are two distinguished sub-groups of material states-with open cracks and with closed cracks. The total number of states equals eight (four in the 'open crack' group). The algorithm of successive stress loading is a natural one for the model. The low shear modulus of modern polymeric composites results in significant changes in the initial reinforcing angles of the plies as a consequence of shear strains, which is why the model considers the effects of the 'structural nonlinearity' of the laminate. The algorithm is capable of predicting both stress/strain curves and failure envelopes for multilayered composites under a variety of loading conditions. Theoretical predictions are presented for a number of cases provided by the organizers of the failure exercise. The strength of laminated composites has been the object of much attention of scientists for a considerable time. Failure processes in real composite are of a great variety and hence, the chapter describes the strengths of particular types of composite of special interest.},

At the industrial mill, bagasse is either incinerated for steam and power generation or discarded as a waste. The incorporation of bagasse waste into polymeric composites for ballistic resistant materials was investigated in this study. Plates of epoxy composites reinforced with either raw bagasse or extracted bagasse fibers were characterized. The 30 vol{\%} bagasse composites were selected as a second layer, backing a front ceramic, in multilayered armors against 7.62 mm ammunition. Ballistic performance of composites was compared to Kevlar™ plates used in commercial multilayered armor systems. Results of ballistic tests indicated that multilayered armors with Kevlar™ and bagasse fiber composites satisfied the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) norm, and displayed similar depths of indentation in a clay witness. By contrast, the armor with raw bagasse composite demonstrated worse performance, with nearly two times deeper indentations, some of which exceeded the NIJ limit. Economical analysis revealed that armor with bagasse fiber composite is nearly 180{\%} less expensive than a corresponding armor with Kevlar™. Therefore, it is shown for the first time that composites reinforced with fibers extracted from sugarcane bagasse (a large scale worldwide generated waste) could replace Kevlar™ in multilayered armor systems making them cheaper and more sustainable.},

abstract = {The dynamic deformation of both edge clamped stainless steel sandwich panels with a pyramidal truss core and equal mass monolithic plates loaded by spherically expanding shells of dry and water saturated sand has been investigated, both experimentally and via a particle based simulation methodology. The spherically expanding sand shell is generated by detonating a sphere of explosive surrounded by a shell of either dry or water saturated synthetic sand. The measurements show that the sandwich panel and plate deflections decrease with increasing stand-off between the center of the charge and the front of the test structures. Moreover, for the same charge and sand mass, the deflections of the plates are significantly higher in the water saturated sand case compared to that of dry sand. For a given stand-off, the mid-span deflection of the sandwich panel rear faces was substantially less than that of the corresponding monolithic plate for both the dry and water saturated sand cases. The experiments were simulated via a coupled discrete-particle/ finite element scheme wherein the high velocity impacting sand is modeled by interacting particles while the plate is modeled within a Lagrangian finite element setting. The simulations are in good agreement with the measurements for the dry sand impact of both the monolithic and sandwich structures. However, the simulations underestimate the effect of stand-off in the case of the water saturated sand explosion, i.e. the deflections decrease more sharply with increasing stand-off in the experiments compared to the simulations. The simulations reveal that the momentum transmitted into the sandwich and monolithic plate structures by the sand shell is approximately the same, consistent with a small fluid-structure interaction effect. The smaller deflection of the sandwich panels is therefore primarily due to the higher bending strength of sandwich structures. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Many studies have led to the belief that the magnificent toughness of nacre is mainly attributed to the inter-platelet adhesive bonds. Results obtained from the finite element analysis show that this is indeed true, and it is imperative that the adhesive bond exhibits adequate toughness in order to be able to spread damage across the entire composite, thereby delaying localised failure.},

abstract = {In this paper, the thermo-viscoplastic behaviour of DH-36 and Weldox-460-E steels is analyzed at wide ranges of strain rates and temperatures. These materials are commonly used for naval applications. Thus, they may be subjected to a wide range of exploitation temperatures and at the same time to high strain rates due to accidental impact or explosion. The thermo-viscoplastic behaviour of these materials has been modeled by application of RK (Rusinek-Klepaczko) constitutive relation. The predictions obtained using RK constitutive relation have been compared with JC (Johnson-Cook) and PB (Physical Base) constitutive relations with use of the experimental results reported in the works of Nemat-Nasser and Guo [Nemat-Nasser, S., Guo, W.G., 2003. Thermomechanical response of DH-36 structural steel over a wide range of strain rates and temperatures. Mech. Mat. 35, 1023-1047] and Borvik et al.

For both metals, a satisfactory agreement is reported between the experimental results and the analytical predictions using RK model at wide ranges of strain rates and temperatures (10-3s-1to 104s-1, and 77 K to about 1000 K). Especially for high strain rate level, the predictions of RK model are notably more precise than those predictions obtained using PB and JC models. This proof converts RK model in suitable for modeling impact problems. Finally, numerical simulations of perforation process of DH-36 and Weldox 460-E steel plates impacted by conical non-deformable projectiles have been carried out using RK and JC models. Numerical results using FE simulations have revealed substantial influence of the constitutive relation concerning the ballistic limit, residual velocity and failure time predictions for the same initial and boundary conditions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, like many other computer languages, it can perform tasks that a handheld computer cannot. Compared to other computer languages, MATLAB provides many built-in functions that make learning easier and reduce prototyping time. Simulink{\textregistered} is a toolbox that extends the possibilities of MATLAB by providing a graphical interface for modeling and simulating dynamical processes.  Using examples from mathematics, mechanical and electrical engineering, and control and signal processing, What Every Engineer Should Know About MATLAB{\textregistered} and Simulink{\textregistered} provides an introduction to these two computer environments and examines the advantages and limitations of MATLAB. It first explores the benefits of how to use MATLAB to solve problems and then process and present calculations and experimental results. This book also briefly introduces the reader to more advanced features of the software, such as object-oriented programming (OOP), and it draws the attention to some specialized toolboxes.  Key features of the book include demonstrations of how to:    Visualize the results of calculations in various kinds of graphical representations   Write useful script files and functions for solving specific problems   Avoid disastrous computational errors   Convert calculations into technical reports and insert calculations and graphs into either MS Word or LaTeX   This book illustrates the limitations of the computer, as well as the implications associated with errors that can result from approximations or numerical errors. Using selected examples of computer-aided errors, the author explains that the set of computer numbers is discrete and bounded—a feature that can cause catastrophic errors if not properly taken into account. In conjunction with The Mathworks—marketers of MATLAB and Simulink—a supplementary website is presented to offer access to software implemented in the book and the script files used to produce the figures.

abstract = {Transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steels have significant volume fractions of retained austenite that can undergo a strain induced transformation into martensite. This transformation, known as the TRIP effect, produces a high hardening capacity that can lead to enhanced formability, which can result in weight reduction and improved vehicle fuel efficiency for automakers. In this paper, a phenomenological framework for TRIP steel is integrated into a Marciniak-Kuczynski (MK) model coupled with a thermal solver to create a new fully coupled thermomechanical formulation to evaluate formability. The constitutive model was calibrated to capture the kinematics of martensite and flow stress dependence on strain rate, temperature, triaxiality, and stress asymmetry for TRIP 800 steel. Several sensitivity and exploratory studies are performed to highlight critical mechanisms for modeling TRIP in formability. Kinematic effects of transformation are shown to have a minor effect on formability compared to the hardening and evolving yield surface effects. Thermal effects, such as conduction, convection, and radiation heat transfer, are shown to be crucial for the formability of TRIP 800 at elevated sheet temperatures with room temperature external boundaries, but not for elevated external boundaries. By modifying the sheet initial thermal conditions, martensite transformation could be controlled to be able to delay localization and enhance formability in the plane strain and uniaxial formability by 25{\%} and 35{\%} respectively.},

The agreements in the magnitude of strains and in the size and shape of shear bands that develop around a hole are very good over most of the loading history.

Silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic and aluminum are selected as the outer and inner layers of the bio-inspired composite scale, respectively. In this study, the optimal thickness ratio of SiC/Al is chosen as 3:2 through numerical simulation on penetration test and residual velocity analysis of bio-inspired composite scale with LS-DYNA. Compared with pure SiC scales, the area density of bio-inspired composite scale can be reduced by 12.5{\%} with the same ballistic performance at the impact velocity of 878 m/s. Further, a comparative simulation analysis among different overlapping ratios of scale-like protection systems, which consists of overlapped bio-inspired composite scales, is conducted and an optimal overlapping ratio of 0.40 is found. The present numerical study on scale-like protection system enables pathways to design a lightweight and flexible protective system.},

Tests have been carried out on 45 mm diameter and 23 mm thick cylindrical specimens. The elastic-plastic pore collapse mechanism has been investigated using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and micro-computed X-ray tomography. A stress-strain relationship for individual specimens at different impact velocities has been obtained with the combination of an analytical method and SHPB theory. The large deformation (∼80{\%}) has been measured from eight strain gauges' data using a wave separation algorithm. The test results exhibited a significant increase in elastic and plastic strength during the pulse loading. The X-ray tomography data of pre-impacted and post-impacted SAF specimens have been extensively analysed to elucidate the internal elastic-plastic pore collapse mechanisms.},

abstract = {A 3-D finite deformation anisotropic visco-plasticity model is presented for fiber composites in total Lagrangian co-ordinates. The plastic potential function is given by a quadratic function in stresses in the local co-ordinates system of the lamina. The model is used to derive the anisotropic plastic constitutive relation of a woven composite made of S-2 glass fibers embedded in polyester resin with approximately 60{\%} by weight of fibers. The coefficients of the constitutive model are experimentally determined through off-axis tension tests and out-of-plane shear tests. Off-axis tension tests are carried out by varying the angle between the fiber orientation and loading direction. The measured stress-strain curves are used to derive a master effective stress-effective plastic strain curve, which is described by two power laws. A modified Arcan fixture is used to carry out pure shear tests to determine the out-of-plane shear coefficient. Compression tests are carried out to establish the material compressive response in the plane of the lamina and along the fiber direction. The anisotropic plasticity model is integrated into the in-house finite element code FEAP98. Numerical analyses are carried out for the off-axis tension tests and compression tests. These analyses show that the model reasonably predicts the constitutive response of woven GRP composites in confirmation with the experimental data. The model further incorporates strain rate and temperature dependence on the anisotropic plastic flow constitutive law. Ballistic penetration simulations are carried out using the integrated code, The velocity at the back surface of the composite target, obtained by analyses, is compared with the data measured experimentally using interferometry. Insight into the failure process is obtained through analysis of different energy dissipation mechanisms.},

abstract = {The behaviour of typical armour steel material under large strains, high strain rates and elevated temperatures needs to be investigated to analyse and reliably predict its response to various types of dynamic loading like impact. An empirical constitutive relation developed by Johnson and Cook (J-C) is widely used to capture strain rate sensitivity of the metals. A failure model proposed by Johnson and Cook is used to model the damage evolution and predict failure in many engineering materials. In this work, model constants of J-C constitutive relation and damage parameters of J-C failure model for a typical armour steel material have been determined experimentally from four types of uniaxial tensile test. Some modifications in the J-C damage model have been suggested and Finite Element simulation of three different tensile tests on armour steel specimens under dynamic strain rate (10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}), high triaxiality and elevated temperature respectively has been done in ABAQUS platform using the modified J-C failure model as user material sub-routine. The simulation results are validated by the experimental data. Thereafter, a moderately high strain rate event viz. Charpy impact test on armour steel specimen has been simulated using J-C material and failure models with the same material parameters. Reasonable agreement between the simulation and experimental results has been achieved.},

To understand the performance of the jet engine, experiments are conducted at four different load types (idle, part load one, part load two and full load). According to the load types, the energy and exergy flows of the engine components and the overall jet engine are investigated. Parameters such as specific fuel consumption, fuel exergy depletion, relative exergy consumption and exergetic improvement potential rate are studied to compare the effects of four load types. Exergy efficiencies and exergy destructions are calculated to explain the thermodynamic inefficiencies. The effect of the load type on the exergy efficiency is analyzed for the components and jet engine itself. At the idle and the part load one cases, the maximum exergy efficiencies took place in the gas turbine as 67.8{\%} and 79.4{\%} respectively. For the part load two and the full load cases, the maximum exergy efficiencies are calculated in the combustion chamber as 81{\%} and 80.6{\%} respectively. The maximum exergy destructions took place in the combustion chamber for all of the load types. They were found to be 35 kW, 40.3 kW, 36.6 kW and 47.9 kW.},

A microstructure model of 3-D braided composite was established to characterize a fully coupled thermo-mechanical response during the fast deformation. High stress state and low heat generation have been found in braided reinforcement. For out-of-plane compression, adiabatic heat concentration is along single diagonal direction at ĝ'100 °C, while a cross-shape heat concentration region is found along two crossed diagonal directions at 26 °C. There are fewer cracks among fiber tows at low temperature. Once the single diagonal shear failure occurs at low temperature, the 3-D braided reinforcement can not keep structure integrity and will be separated into two parts. For in-plane compression, the damage morphology at ĝ'100 °C is similar to that at 26 °C. Under the influence from the fiber tows, the adiabatic heating develops the zigzag-shape damage with veins and stripes along the braiding angle in composite, while the 3-D braided reinforcement still keeps its structural integrity.},

abstract = {The approach for joining thermosetting matrix composites (TSCs) proposed in this study is based on the use of a low melting co-cured thermoplastic film, added as a last ply in the stacking sequence of the composite laminate. During curing, the thermoplastic film partially penetrates in the first layer of the thermosetting composite, leading to macro-mechanical interlocking as the main connection mechanism between the thermoplastic film and the underlying composite. After curing, the thermosetting composite joints with the thermoplastic modified surface can be assembled by welding. Welding of the TSC-TSC joints is performed by ultrasonic and induction welding. The weld strength is investigated by morphological characterization of cross sections and failure surfaces and by mechanical testing. The effect of the thermoplastic film thickness on the welding process and on its outcome is also analyzed. Both induction and ultrasonic welding mostly result in good-quality welded joints. The welding process used as well as the initial thickness of the thermoplastic film are found to have a significant effect on the final thickness of the weld line and on the location of failure. Thicker thermoplastic films are found to ease the welding processes.},

In the present study, the influence of fracture criterion in numerical simulations of the perforation process has been studied for three different steel alloys. The five-parameter Johnson-Cook fracture criterion, which is calibrated based on several relatively simple tensile tests, is found to give both qualitatively and quantitatively good results for this kind of impact problem. However, this study will also show that a one-parameter fracture criterion where only one simple material test is required for calibration, is found to give similar results as the Johnson-Cook criterion. The study indicates that the ballistic limit can be quantitatively well predicted independent of the chosen fracture criterion, but qualitatively some differences are seen during the perforation process. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {One of the novel technologies for natural gas dehydration and natural gas dew-point conditioning is supersonic separation, which has remarkable features, including compact and maintenance-free design. Due to its complex design and the difficulty of experimental analysis, researchers tend to conduct numerical modeling for behavior investigation of the nozzle focusing on shockwave which is the main phenomena inside the nozzle. The present NN-model outperforms a selection of data and proposes an efficient NN-based algorithm for shockwave position estimation as the key nozzle geometry parameter. Data for the shockwave location was collected from a wide range of results from the literature and then a neural network based self-organizing map was adapted to the dataset. This created a classified dataset and the use of unreal weight and repeated experimental results from different research were avoided. A neural network was employed for modeling the shockwave location through the nozzle using a better quality dataset. Additionally, the one-dimensional inviscid theory was utilized in the recursive approach for comparison to the main proposed model. Simulation results presented in this research reveal the effectiveness of the proposed neural network technique for supersonic nozzle modeling and make it possible to determine the shockwave location from the nozzle pressure boundary conditions. The results showed that the supersonic nozzle separation have capability to be used in both low-pressure applications and high pressure ones. The dimensionless length for shockwave location is predicted in the range of 0.82–0.92 for the former and 0.72 to 0.95 for the later, depending on pressure recovery ratio.},

Current designs have often considered only nominal operating conditions for vehicle control design. This work seeks to address issues that arise when deviating significantly from the hover flight regime. Aided by well established research for helicopter flight control, three separate aerodynamic effects are investigated as they pertain to quadrotor flight, due to vehicular velocity, angle of attack, and airframe design. They cause moments that affect attitude control, and thrust variation that affects altitude control. Where possible, a theoretical development is first presented, and is then validated through both thrust test stand measurements and vehicle flight tests using the Stanford Testbed of Autonomous Rotorcraft for Multi-Agent Control (STARMAC) quadrotor helicopter. The results enabled improved controller performance.},

The experiments performed in this study aimed to identify whether alterations to the composite skins or core of a sandwich panel can yield improved blast resilience both in air and underwater. Underwater blast loads using 1.28 kg TNT equivalent charge at a stand-off distance of 1 m were performed on four different composite sandwich panels. Results revealed that implementing a stepwise graded density foam core, with increasing density away from the blast, reduces the deflection of the panel and damage sustained. Furthermore, the skin material affects the extent of panel deflection and damage, the lower strain to failure of carbon-fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) skins reduces deflection but increases skin debonding. A further two panels were subjected to a 100 kg TNT air blast loading at a 15 m stand-off to compare the effect of a graded density core and the results support the underwater blast results. Future modelling of these experiments will aid the design process and should aim to include material damage mechanisms to identify the most suitable skins.},

abstract = {The paper deals with the multi-objective optimization problems of laminated composite beam structures. The objective function is to minimize the weight of the whole laminated composite beam and maximize the natural frequency. In particular, the simultaneous use of all the design variables such as fiber volume fractions, thickness and fiber orientation angles of layers is conducted, in which the fiber volume fractions are taken as continuous design variables with the constraint on manufacturing process while the thickness and fiber orientation angles are considered as discrete variables. The beam structure is subjected to the constraint in the natural frequency which must be greater than or equal to a predetermined frequency. For free vibration analysis of the structure, the finite element method is used with the two-node Bernoulli-Euler beam element. For solving the multi-objective optimization problem, the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is employed. The reliability and effectiveness of the proposed approach are demonstrated through three numerical examples by comparing the current results with those of previous studies in the literature.},

abstract = {Blast loads from explosion (either accidental or intentional) can be mitigated by using thick armor systems that are often heavy and signifi cantly affect the payload of the structure. In the design of structures for blast protection, sacrifi cial claddings which consist of high-energy-absorbing components are often used. Sandwich-type cladding structures with lightweight cores are now becoming more popular for blast mitigation applications, including armor systems, because of their capability to carry transverse loads with minimal weight penalty and absorb large amount of plastic energy. The choice of the sandwich core has signifi cant infl uence on the performance of the sandwich panels. Typical cores are wood, different foam materials, or tubular structures. Because of its high energy absorption capabilities, tubular structures are commonly used. This chapter presents a “state of the art” on the use of tubular struc- tures as cores for sandwich panels subjected to blast and dynamic loading.},

The in-plane stress analysis was enhanced by considering residual curing stresses, contact area increase during perforation, and strain rate effect on material properties. In comparison to test results, the model predicted with a precision of 5{\%} contact time, impact force, maximum displacement, perforation energy, and impact velocity. In addition to these common impact characteristics, further evaluation gave relevant insight on the role of the material constituents, i.e. 2024-T3 aluminium and S2-glass/FM94-epoxy prepreg, with respect to energy absorption, plate flexure, and damage progression.

abstract = {The use of vehicle bombs to attack city centers has been a feature of campaigns by terrorist organizations around the world. A bomb explosion within or immediately nearby a building can cause catastrophic damage on the building's external and internal structural frames, collapsing of walls, blowing out of large expanses of windows, and shutting down of critical life-safety systems. Loss of life and injuries to occupants can result from many causes, including direct blast-effects, structural collapse, debris impact, fire, and smoke. The indirect effects can combine to inhibit or prevent timely evacuation, thereby contributing to additional casualties. In addition, major catastrophes resulting from gas-chemical explosions result in large dynamic loads, greater than the original design loads, of many structures. Due to the threat from such extreme loading conditions, efforts have been made during the past three decades to develop methods of structural analysis and design to resist blast loads. The analysis and design of structures subjected to blast loads require a detailed understanding of blast phenomena and the dynamic response of various structural elements. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the effects of explosion on structures. An explanation of the nature of explosions and the mechanism of blast waves in free air is given. This paper also introduces different methods to estimate blast loads and structural response.},

abstract = {Aluminium alloys are widely used in the design of structural parts in the automotive and aircraft manufacturing because of their good specific mechanical properties. Many of the critical situations in these types of industries such as crash or impact phenomena as well as forming processes are related to high strain-rate deformations and adiabatic heating. Therefore, knowing flow and failure behaviour of materials under dynamic loading and applying reliable constitutive models is essential for designing the structural components safely. Johnson-Cook model is one of the most long-established constitutive relations in the dynamic field due to its simplicity and easy calibration. Nevertheless, empirical models do not collect and give information about the reason why materials behave in the way that they do, so micromechanical motivated continuum models are interesting for that. In the present work, authors analyse the mechanical dynamic behaviour of the aeronautical alloy Al2024-T3. An experimental study has been planned performing tests on sheet specimens at different strain-rates and temperatures to analyse the effect of these parameters. Low strain-rate experiments were conducted using a servo-hydraulic machine while high strain-rate tests were carried out using a split-Hopkinson tension bar. Testing temperatures were set at room and 373K by using a furnace made of resistors. The material behaviour is modelled using a micromechanical-based constitutive and a phenomenological failure model. Plastic flow of the material is defined by means of Orowan relation, where both temperature and strain-rate effect are included in the flow rule and the strain hardening law is just a function of equivalent plastic strain; while failure criterion is based on Cockcroft-Latham model. Strain fields on sample surfaces, which were used for obtaining the true stress-strain curves and performing a hybrid experimental-numerical failure calibration, were obtained by means of Digital Image Correlation technique.},

Constitutive models which take into account the physical progressive failure behaviour of fibres, matrix, and interfaces between plies were implemented in an explicit finite element method and used in the simulation of low-velocity impact events on composite laminates. The computational effort resulted in reliable predictions of the impact dynamics, impact footprint, locus and size of delaminations, matrix cracks and fibre damage, as well as the amount of energy dissipated through delaminations, intraply damage and friction.

A new failure theory, the Northwestern (NU-Daniel) theory, has been proposed for predicting lamina yielding and failure under multi-axial states of stress including strain rate effects. It is primarily applicable to matrix-dominated interfiber/interlaminar failures. It is based on micromechanical failure mechanisms but is expressed in terms of easily measured macroscopic lamina stiffness and strength properties. It is presented in the form of a master failure envelope incorporating strain rate effects. The theory was further adapted and extended to the prediction of in situ first ply yielding and failure (FPY and FPF) and progressive failure of multi-directional laminates under static and dynamic loadings. The significance of this theory is that it allows for rapid screening of new composite materials without extensive testing and offers easily implemented design tools.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the ballistic limits, energy absorption behaviour and the mechanisms that lead to perforation in Twaron{\textregistered} CT 716 plain-woven, single-ply fabric by different shaped projectiles. The projectile shapes tested are flat head, hemispherical head, ogival head (CRH 2.5) and conical head (half angle of 30°). Results show that while the amount of energy absorbed by the fabric is quantitatively different for all four projectiles, they show similar trends - energy absorbed increases with impact velocity up to a critical impact velocity before it starts to decrease. The energy absorption capability of the Twaron{\textregistered} fabric is explained by considering how impact energy is converted to strain energy and kinetic energy of the fabric. Each projectile shape was also found to perforate the fabric through different mechanisms - yarn rupture, fibrillation, failure by friction, and bowing. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {As a part of the Second World-Wide Failure Exercise, the originators (or their collaborators) of three-dimensional failure theories applied their methods to 12 carefully selected challenging problems (test cases). In this article, the 'blind' theoretical predictions from 12 failure theories, making the backbone of Part (A) of the Second World-Wide Failure Exercise, are compiled in a structured manner. Key features in each theory are identified including: types of failure models employed, whether linear or nonlinear analysis was carried out, reliance on software and numerical methods, allowance for thermal stresses and identification of modes of failure. The results (failure envelopes and stress-strain curves) have been superimposed to show similarities and differences between the predictions of the various theories. In addition, bar charts have been constructed to demonstrate the levels of agreement between the predicted failure stresses and strains. Sources of differences between the predictions of the various three-dimensional failure theories are discussed. Further publications are planned in Part B in which comparison will be made between the predictions described here and the experimental results.},

abstract = {Although advanced lightweight composite based armors are available, high hardness steels in military vehicles are often used to provide ballistic protection at a relatively low cost and is an interesting material due to its widespread usage in vehicle structure. In this study, ballistic limit of 500 HB armor steel was determined against 7.62 mm 54R B32 API hardened steel core ammunition. Lagrange and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations were carried out using 3D model of bullet and high hardness armor target. Perforation tests on 9 and 20 mm thickness armor were performed to validate simulation methodology. Also material tests were performed for armor steel and ammunition hardened steel core to develop Johnson-Cook constitutive relations for both strength and failure models. Finally, results from 3D numerical simulations with detailed models of bullet and target were compared with experiments. The study indicates that the ballistic limit can be quantitatively well predicted independent of chosen simulation methodology, but qualitatively some differences are seen during perforation and fragmentation. As shown in results, good agreement between Ls-Dyna simulations and experimental data was achieved by Lagrange formulation with the full bullet model. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This technology combines some important specifications of the latters, as the possibility of re-ignition, thrust modulation, a higher specific impulse than solid systems, a greater simplicity and a lower cost than liquid systems. Nevertheless the highly oxidizing environment represents a major problem as regards the thermo-oxidation and ablative behavior of nozzle materials. The main goal of this research is to characterize a silicon carbide based micro-concrete with a maximum aggregates size of 800 $\mu$m, in a hybrid propulsion environment. The nozzle throat has to resist to a highly oxidizing polyethylene/nitrous oxide hybrid environment, under temperatures up to 2900 K. Three tests were performed on concrete-based nozzles in HERA Hybrid Rocket Motor (HRM) test bench at ONERA. Pressure chamber evolution and observations before and after tests are used to investigate the ablated surface at nozzle throat. Ablation behavior and crack generation are discussed and some improvements are proposed.},

abstract = {A new continuum damage model, the wing crack damage (WCD) model, was developed for the analysis of brittle failure of transversely isotropic solids. Special attention was paid to the analysis of axial splitting under compression and tensile cracking under tension. In addition to the WCD model a three-dimensional version of the damage model proposed by Murakami and Kamiya was enhanced and implemented in ABAQUS/Standard FE software. The proposed WCD model is based on the use of the damage vector. The vector represents both the normal direction of the surface of the plane crack and the size of the damaged area. Damaging induces anisotropy in an originally transversely isotropic material. The evolution equations for damage are motivated by the wing crack growth mechanism. The evolution is based on propagation of pre-existing damage. The proposed model enables modelling of pre-existing cracks. The feature can be exploited in studying the effect of orientation and size distribution of pre- existing cracks on the failure of materials. The model was implemented in ABAQUS/Standard FE software as a user subroutine. The unsymmetrical behaviour of cracked materials under tension and compression due to the opening and closure of cracks is taken into account in the proposed model. In the work it was shown that the widely used strain-based crack closure criteria cannot be reliably applied in a two- and three-dimensional stress state. To attain a deformation localisation zone of finite width, a damage rate-dependent damage surface was introduced. The validity of the proposed model was verified by testing it against five basic structures composed of known natural materials (ice, marble and concrete). The numerical simulations revealed the capability of the model in modelling brittle failure modes of transversely isotropic materials.},

The FE (finite element) software, ABAQUS/Explicit is employed to simulate low-velocity impact characteristics and predict residual tensile strength of carbon fiber composite lattice core sandwich structures. These numerical investigations create a user-defined material subroutine (VUMAT) to enhance the damage simulation which includes Hashin and Yeh failure criteria.

From results of this paper, the degradation of residual tensile strength can be divided to three stages for different impact energies, and amplitudes of degradation are affected by stacking sequences. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Fracture toughness was determined by measurement of bend angle of the cantilever beams. Results obtained with this method were in agreement with those from conventional compliance and area methods. Two different fracture modes were observed: interlaminar and intralaminar. In the interlaminar fracture mode, crack jumps in the space between two neighbouring 0° and 90° plies were observed. With the interlaminar fracture mode, during crack initiation GIcdecreased with crack length. Intralaminar fracture mode consisted of the gradual growth of a crack through a 0° ply. Fibres bridging the opposite sides of the crack were observed in this case, and fracture toughness GIcdid not change with crack length. GIc(420 J m-2) at intralaminar fracture mode was approximately twice that at interlaminar fracture mode (220 J m-2). The difference in fracture toughness was explained by the dissipation of energy by fibres bridging the opposite sides of the crack at intralaminar fracture mode. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Ti–6Al–4V matrix composites enhanced by alumina tubes filled with boron carbide, alumina rods, and alumina plate is termed high gradient composite because of the big density differences among Ti–6Al–4V, alumina, and boron carbide materials. This high gradient composite has been developed for a theoretical study to help determine the best configuration for armor protection. This is the first attempt where materials are prepared using a powder processing method with the specific goal to address the ballistic performance. Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) was first used to manufacture ballistic grade Ti–6Al–4V alloy and high gradient composites incorporating Al2O3 rods, plates, and tubes filled with B4C powders. Processing parameters were investigated and optimized based on materials properties. An important feature of powder-based materials is the lack of texture in comparison with traditional material. Several configurations of this high gradient composite were designed and tested by long rod penetration tests. High gradient composite materials demonstrated new damage patterning features during the long rod projectile penetration process. These features include projectile deflection, self-sealing of the hole, and forced shear localization in the direction of 45 to the impact line caused by fracture of Al2O3 tubes on the initial stage of penetration process. Powder filled voids and rods induced volume distributed, highly heterogeneous pattern of damage initiated by cavities and their interactions. The test results are shown and analyzed in depth in this paper. The results prove that the powder-based approach can be used for processing of materials suitable for ballistic applications.},

This study aims at investigating the impact response of GFRP composites at different temperature environments, which are encountered in their service at high attitude and low earth orbit (LEO) conditions. 18 GFRP samples were fabricated by vacuum infusion process and 9 of them were post-cured at 353 K for 3 h to ensure that a complete chemical reaction inside the samples was achieved. Low velocity drop weight test was performed for the samples prepared and then stored at room temperature (295 K), dry ice temperature (199 K) and liquid nitrogen temperature (100 K) conditions. The apparent damages and their size were visually examined and measured. Impact parameters such as impact load, deflection and energy absorption of each damage type were also analyzed. Besides, the post-curing effect was also studied to verify its significance to the impact properties of composites. Experimental results showed that GFRP composites at cryogenic condition exhibited smaller apparent damage and were stiffer as compared with other cases. However, they demonstrated relatively poor energy absorbability at low temperature condition. It was also found that post-curing could reduce the apparent damage and increase the energy absorption of GFRP composites.},

The use of structured meshes, aligned with fiber directions allows the physically-sound simulation of matrix cracks parallel to fiber directions, and their interaction with the development of delaminations. The implementation of element erosion criteria and the application of intraply and interlaminar friction allow for the simulation of fiber splits and their entanglement, which in turn results in permanent indentation in the impacted laminate.

abstract = {The explicit finite element method is applied in this work to simulate the coupled and highly non-linear thermo-mechanical phenomena that occur during steel solidification in continuous casting processes. Variable mass scaling is used to efficiently model these processes in their natural time scale using a Lagrangian formulation. An efficient and robust local–global viscoplastic integration scheme (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engng 2006; 66:1955–1989) to solve the highly temperature- and rate-dependent elastic– viscoplastic constitutive equations of solidifying steel has been implemented into the commercial software ABAQUS/Explicit (ABAQUS User Manuals v6.7. Simulia Inc., 2007) using a VUMAT subroutine. The model is first verified with a known semi-analytical solution from Weiner and Boley (J. Mech. Phys. Solids 1963; 11:145–154). It is then applied to simulate temperature and stress development in solidifying shell sections in continuous casting molds using realistic temperature-dependent properties and including the effects of ferrostatic pressure, narrow face taper, and mechanical contact. Example simulations include a fully coupled thermo-mechanical analysis of a billet-casting and thin-slab casting in a funnel mold. Explicit temperature and stress results are compared with the results of an implicit formulation and computing times are benchmarked for different problem sizes and different numbers of processor cores. The explicit formulation exhibits significant advantages for this class of contact-solidification problems, especially with large domains on the latest parallel computing platforms.

These equations, referred to here as characteristic curves, can be fitted by means of power equations, which depend on the TNT equivalent mass. Characteristic curves allow determination of overpressure and impulse at each distance. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This article shows the application of basic mathematical and geometric principles to the normal morphology of structures regularly involved in orthodontics and dentistry. For appreciation of beauty, it has been suggested that the human mind functions at the limbic level in attraction to proportions in harmony with the Golden Section. This is a proportion of 1.618 and its reciprocal 0.618 in geometry. Fibonacci numbers express precisely the same ratio and are mathematically unique and mysterious. Questions arose regarding these geometric and mathematical relationships in our living patients. Studies were conducted from measurements of models of the teeth of normal-occlusion subjects, the photographs of the faces of commercial models, and conditions found in lateral and frontal cephalometric head films. Variations of the beautiful photographic models were analyzed together with computerized composites of patients with ideal occlusions. Several key relationships were found. The investigation yielded useful relationships for all aspects of dentistry and particularly for orthodontics and orthognathic surgery. The normal face and the occlusion of the teeth have a majestic beauty. The study strongly suggests that esthetics can indeed be made scientific rather than the need to resort to subjective perceptions as in the past. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

Digital image correlation (DIC) was used to obtain full-field data for the rear-face of each deforming target. A steel plate of comparable mass per unit area was also subjected to the same blast conditions for comparison. The experimental data was then verified with finite element models generated in Abaqus/Explicit. Close agreement was obtained between the numerical and experimental results, confirming that the CFRP panels had a superior blast performance to the GFRP panels. Moreover all composite targets sustained localised failures (that were more severe in the GFRP targets) but retained their original shape post blast. The rear-skins remained intact for each composite target with core shear failure present.},

abstract = {The manuscript presents a systematic study for the characterization of mild steel under varying stress-triaxiality, strain rate and temperature. The effect of stress triaxiality was studied by performing tension tests on notched cylindrical specimens. The radius of the notch has been varied as 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10 mm. The smooth cylindrical specimens were tested under tension at varying strain rate and temperature. The strain rate in the range, 0.0006 s-1-1500 s-1, was obtained on a universal testing machine and the Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus. The tests at elevated temperature were carried out using a portable furnace which enabled the variation of temperature from 100°C to 750°C. All the material parameters for the Johnson-Cook elasto-viscoplastic material model have been calibrated. The parameters thus obtained were validated by numerically simulating the material characterization under high strain rate using ABAQUS/Explicit finite element code. The numerical simulations were also carried out for the ballistic evaluation of 12 and 16 mm thick mild steel plates impacted by 7.62 AP projectiles at varying incidence velocities in order to obtain the ballistic limit. The angle of incidence has also been varied until the occurrence of critical ricochet. The numerical results have been validated by the experiments reported in earlier studies, Gupta and Madhu [1,2].},

@article{DeFreitas2000,
abstract = {Composite panels are in common use, especially in aeronautic and aerospace structures due to their high strength/weight and stiffness/weight ratio. The out-of-plane impact loading is considered potentially dangerous mainly because the damage may be left undetected and because the loading itself acts in the through-the-thickness direction of the laminated composite panel. This direction is the weakest in the composite since no fibres are present in that direction. The impact loading can lead to damage involving three modes of failure: matrix cracking, delamination and eventually fibre breakage for higher impact energies. Even when no visible impact damage is observed at the surface on the point of impact, matrix cracking and delamination can occur, and the residual strength of the composite is considerably reduced. The objective of this study is to determine the mechanisms of the damage growth of impacted composite laminates when subjected to impact loading. For this purpose a series of impact tests were carried out on composite laminates made of carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resin matrix. An instrumented drop-weight-testing was used together with a C-scan ultrasonic device for the damage identification. Two stacking sequences of two different epoxy resins and carbon fibres, representative of four different elastic behaviours with a different number of interfaces were used. A numerical evaluation of these specimens was also carried out, using static analysis only. Results showed that the delaminated area due to impact loading depends on the number of interfaces between plies. Two failure mechanisms due to impact were identified, which are influenced by the stacking sequence and by the thickness of the panels.},

abstract = {Normal and oblique impact on 20 mm thick AA6082-T4 aluminium plates are studied both experimentally and numerically. Two types of small arms bullets were used in the ballistic tests, namely the 7.62 × 63 mm NATO Ball (with a soft lead core) and the 7.62 × 63 mm APM2 (with a hard steel core), fired from a long smooth-bore Mauser rifle. The targets were struck at 0°, 15°, 30°, 45° and 60° obliquity, and the impact velocity was about 830 m/s in all tests. During testing, the initial and residual bullet velocities were measured by various laser-based optical devices, and high-speed video cameras were used to photograph the penetration process. Of special interest is the critical oblique angle at which the penetration process changes from perforation to embedment or ricochet. The results show that the critical oblique angle was less than 60° for both bullet types. A material test programme was also conducted for the AA6082-T4 plate to calibrate a modified Johnson-Cook constitutive relation and the Cockcroft-Latham failure criterion, while material data for the bullets mainly were taken from the literature. 3D non-linear FE simulations with detailed models of the bullets were finally run. Good agreement between the FE simulations and the experimental results for the APM2 bullets was in general obtained, while it was more difficult to get reliable FE results for the soft core Ball bullets. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Designing lightweight high-performance materials that can sustain high impulsive loadings is of great interest to marine and civil applications. When designing tough, strong new materials from relatively weak components, mimicking structures from nature can be a highly promising strategy, as illustrated by nacre from red abalone shells. One of nacre's most impressive features is its ability to laterally spread damage and dissipate energy over millimetre length scales at crack tips and other defects. In this work, a composite panel is redesigned to mimic nacre's microstructure. The bio-inspired composite panel and the original composite structure, which have identical areal mass, are subjected to an underwater impulsive loading scenario. Their performances are compared numerically in terms of damage and deflection. A finite element fluid-structure interaction model is developed to capture the water impact on E-glass/vinylester composite facets and to provide insights into the deformation modes and failure mechanisms. Damage and degradation in individual unidirectional composite laminas are simulated using Hashin's composite damage model. The delamination between laminas is modelled by a bilinear cohesive model. Results interpreted from this numerical study will be used as guidance for the future manufacturing and experimental characterisation of bio-inspired composite structures. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In the present article, efficiency, accuracy, strengths and limitations of this method in predicting and discretely optimizing impact response of FRP composites have been studied through a case study on polypropylene/E-glass laminates with unidirectional, plain, and twill weave architectures. In parallel, drop weight impact tests, X-ray micro-tomography, and pre- and post-impact four-point flexural testing are employed for two purposes: (a) gaining further knowledge on induced impact damage mechanisms, and (b) further assessment and verification of the Taguchi results. In spite of the fact that impact events of the FRP laminates are highly nonlinear and accompany high level of uncertainty, it was found that this design of experiments method is capable of predicting and maximizing the absorbed impact energy with a reduced number of runs and reasonable error. Finally, by correlating macro-level predictions to micro-level damage observations via X-ray tomography, the underlying assumptions of the method were further scrutinized, and in particular it was found that the plies interaction effect is not a limiting factor in predicting the total absorbed energy of the laminates. Overall, the experimental time/cost saving in the performed impact optimization case study was over 50{\%} using the Taguchi L9 orthogonal array.},

abstract = {The knowledge of impact behaviour of heat exposed composites is very limited, even though this could be one of the critical issues for many practical applications. Therefore, the current study was conducted to investigate the effect of preheating on the impact performance of glass and flax fibre reinforced composite laminates by a comprehensive set of experiments. The composite laminates were partially damaged by heat convection (using a fan assisted furnace) and their impact properties, such as force and energy absorption, were measured under a low velocity (1.85 m/s) impact loading situation. The impact test results showed that the heat exposure at 300 °C increased the energy absorption of the glass fibre composites but reduced those of the flax fibre composites. Furthermore, an addition of ammonium polyphosphate, as a flame retardant, also incremented the absorbed energy of the heat exposed composites and significantly reduced the heat release rate, resulting in an acceptable vertical burning behaviour, that meets the aviation standard requirements.},

abstract = {Unit cell modeling of the woven fabric composites is a strong tool for studying fabric behavior at meso-level. Among the suggested methods the three-dimensional finite element analysis is found to be promising and of greater interest to researchers in the field. However, due to the multi-scale nature and particular behavior of fibrous yarns, numerical procedures applicable to woven fabrics differ from conventional finite element routines. Moreover, from a practical point of view, most of the models in the literature focus on the ideal unit cells and excludes the meso-level uncertainty factors. On the other hand, experimental measurements indicate non-repeatability of test data which is a result of embedded inherent uncertainties. In this study, a finite element model capable of defining the representative volume element of a plain weave under homogenous loading has been created. Because of particular behavior of dry fabrics, a special constitutive material behaviour is defined via user-defined subroutines, which links to the solver of a finite element package (Abaqus). Material properties of yarns for dry glass fabrics are extracted by fitting their numerical responses to results of experiments. Subsequently, geometrical and material meso-level uncertainty factors are studied separately using two-level factorial designs. The output of runs are inserted into a commercial design package (Design Expert) for producing results in terms of probability plots, effects and percentage contribution of each factor and their interactions. Result shows that depending on the loading type, there are factors that show significant contribution toward the final response, whereas others are quite negligible. More elaboration on the design results provides informative conclusions regarding modeling of unit cells, as well as their behavior during different loading steps. These conclusions can be used in more comprehensive unit-cell homogenization formulations, as well as for defining appropriate tolerances for meso-level defects in woven fabric composites. iii Table of Contents Abstract .},

abstract = {Ballistic tests were conducted using hard-steel cylinders of two diameters and three nose shapes against glass-fibre-reinforced plastic (GRP) composite plates of various thicknesses. The data when plotted as energy to penetrate as a function of target thickness exhibit simple bi-linear relationships. This is also found to be the case for a broad range of reported composite ballistic impact data. A simple model is developed to explain the bi-linear behaviour and to provide the basis for geometrical scaling of composite ballistic perforation data, and also to help with the interpretation of material parameter and bond strength influences on ballistic resistance. The study also shows that energy absorption in thin GRP targets is largely independent of projectile nose geometry and that thin GRP and Kevlar targets respond similarly on a thickness basis to impact by fragment simulating projectiles. Measurements on geometric damage parameters in the perforated composites are presented.},

abstract = {Drilling of composite material structure is a widely used process in aeronautical assembly due to its best manufacturing value (ratio quality/cost). However, delamination which can be generated at the hole exit is still a problem and is directly related to the drill axial force, the composite material mechanical characteristics and the load distribution along the cutting and chisel edges. This paper analyzes the distribution of the load along the drill edges and points out a triangular distribution associated to an additional load located at the centre of the drill. This additional load depends strongly on the feed rate. An orthotropic analytical model is then proposed in order to determine the delamination critical thrust during drilling for different combined loadings. This new model is compared with the existing ones in the literature and with experimental results. This analysis highlights that delamination occurs in a mixed mode and not in mode I only. The use of the B-K criterion for the determination of the equivalent critical energy release rate GCand a cutting edge combined loading (triangular distribution associated to an additional load) allow a close correlation between experimental measurements and the prediction of this new model.},

Thermal spraying, laser surfacing, electron beam welding are the most widely used techniques to alter the surface morphology of base metal. Preliminary studies reveal that the coating and layering of aluminium alloys with ceramic particles enhance the ballistic resistance. Furthermore, among aluminium alloys, 7075 aluminium alloy exhibits high strength which can be compared to that of steels and has profound applications in the designing of lightweight fortification structures and integrated protection systems. Having limitations such as poor bond integrity, formation of detrimental phases and interfacial reaction between reinforcement and substrate using fusion route to deposit hard particles paves the way to adopt friction stir processing for fabricating surface composites using different sizes of boron carbide particles as reinforcement on armour grade 7075 aluminium alloy as matrix in the present investigation. Wear and ballistic tests were carried out to assess the performance of friction stir processed AA7075 alloy. Significant improvement in wear resistance of friction stir processed surface composites is attributed to the change in wear mechanism from abrasion to adhesion. It has also been observed that the surface metal matrix composites have shown better ballistic resistance compared to the substrate AA7075 alloy. Addition of solid lubricant MoS2 has reduced the depth of penetration of the projectile to half that of base metal AA7075 alloy. For the first time, the friction stir processing technique was successfully used to improve the wear and ballistic resistances of armour grade high strength AA7075 alloy.},

The results of the mechanical tests and the fractographic study of the fracture surfaces were correlated to the stress-state dependent ultimate strength of epoxy resins. This plays an important role in fibre reinforced composites, because just after cooling to room temperature the resin matrix is in a tri-axial residual stress-state. The mechanical properties of the neat resin described by the parabolic failure criterion is able to explain the low strain to failure of unidirectional laminates under transverse tensile loading.},

abstract = {Many police body armor systems are dual purpose, offering both ballistic and knife re-sistance by combining a flexible ballistic textile pack with a stiffer knife resistant layer. The two types of protection differ in materials and mechanisms such that each individual component may help or interfere with the function of the other. This paper investigates the effect on knife and ballistic penetration resistance when a single thin metal plate was placed at various different positions within an aramid textile armor pack. Two metallic layers were used: aluminum 7075 and commercial purity titanium; these had similar areal densities and were positioned in the front, middle, and back of a 20 layer pack of woven Kevlar V R 49. An instrumented drop weight machine was used to deliver a repeat-able knife blade impact at comparable energy levels to those specified in the UK Home Office test standards for knife resistance. Ballistic tests were used to determine the V 50 ballistic limit velocity against typical 9 mm and 0.357 Magnum handgun threats. Against a stabbing threat, it was found that positioning the metal plate in the middle of the pack provided the greatest resistance to knife penetration by a factor of almost two, while a plate at the front of the pack provided less resistance and plates positioned at the rear of the pack provided the least resistance to penetration. Against the ballistic threat, the pen-etration resistance of the textile pack can be significantly improved when a metal plate is at the front of the pack, while for all other positions the effect is negligible. However, this effect is sensitive to both the ammunition type and the metal plate composition. When the metal plate is positioned at the rear of the pack there is a significant decrease in the back-face deformation of the armor pack although, again, this effect is only present for certain ammunition and metal combinations. The overall effect of combining soft and hard elements was that specific performance parameters could be substantially increased by the correct combination. There were no significant negative effects, however, in a number of cases, the combined systems performance was no greater than that of a single element type, despite the added weight.},

The method combines the modified Mori-Tanaka method and woven fiber composite modeling, which are used to predict the thermal conductivities of carbon nanotube(CNT)/polymer composites and CNT/woven fiber/polymer multiscale composites, respectively. The thermal-electrical circuit analogy was applied to the unit cell of a multiscale woven fiber composite, which allowed predictions of conductivities in both in-plane and through-thickness directions. The experimental validations on woven fiber composites and multiscale composites revealed that thermal conductivity predictions based on the proposed modeling approaches agreed well with the experimental results, taking into account the effects of CNT content, fiber volume fraction, constituent conductivities, and fiber undulation.},

The composite laminates used in this experiment were CF/EPOXY orthotropic laminated plates with lay-up [06/906]sand [04/904]s, and CF/PEEK orthotropic laminated plates with a lay-up of [06/906]s. A steel ball launched by the air gun was used to generate the CFRP laminate impact damage. For impact-damaged specimens, nondestructive evaluation (NDE), such as a scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) was performed on the delamination-damaged samples to characterize damage growth at different temperatures. Therefore, this study was undertaken to experimentally determine the interrelations between impact energy and impact damage (i.e. the delamination area and matrix) of CFRP laminates (CF/EPOXY and CF/PEEK) subjected to foreign object damages (FOD) at low and high temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Improvements in mechanical properties at low temperatures are desirable for epoxy resins such as diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) that are often used in cryogenic engineering applications. In this study, a hydroxyl functionalized hyperbranched polymer (H30) is employed to improve the mechanical properties of a DGEBA epoxy resin at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). The results show that the tensile strength, failure strain (ductility) and impact strength at 77 K are simultaneously improved by adding a proper content of H30. The maximum tensile strength at 77 K is increased by 17.7{\%} from 98.2 MPa of pure epoxy resin to 115.6 MPa of modified epoxy system for the 10 wt{\%} H30 content. The failure strain at 77 K increases consistently with the increase of H30 content. The maximum impact strength at 77 K is attained by introduction of 10 wt{\%} H30 with an improvement of 26.3{\%} over that of pure epoxy resin. For the purpose of comparison, the mechanical properties of modified epoxy resins at room temperature (RT) are also investigated. It is interesting to note that the impact strength is not lower at 77 K than that at RT for the modified systems. Moreover, the glass transition temperature (Tg) is not reduced by the addition of H30 in appropriate amounts. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, based on LS-Dyna code, a new finite element (FE) simulation of the ballistic perforation of the ceramic/composite targets, which impacted by cylindrical tungsten projectiles, has been presented. Research on this method has been conducted by a few research groups in recent years. The ceramic material, which is the front plate, has been made of Alumina 99.5{\%} and composite back-up plate composed of Twaron fibers. The 2-dimensional (2D), axi-symmetric, dynamic-explicit, Lagrangian model has been considered in this simulation. The Johnson-Cook, Johnson-Holmquist and Composite-Damage materials behaviors have been used for projectile, ceramic and composite materials respectively. The brittle fracture and fragmentation of ceramic conoid, the failure criteria based on fracture of fibers or matrixes of composite materials and erosion or flattening of projectile during perforation have been considered. The residual velocity and perforation time has been obtained and compared with the available analytical models. The results show that when the ceramic is impacted by a projectile, a fragmented ceramic conoid breaks from ceramic tile and the semi-angle of ceramic conoid with increasing initial velocity decreases. Furthermore, the dishing of composite layers at high impact velocities and the delamination of layers near the ballistic limit velocity decrease. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Three E-glass fabrics, non-crimp fabric, woven fabric, and nonwoven mat, were selected as reinforcements for the composite laminates. Impact tests were conducted using a guided drop-weight test rig in ascending energy to 24 J/layer nominal impact energy. Metallographic microscopy was used to observe the damage characteristics of the perpendicular cross-section of the impacted laminates after a micropowder polishing treatment. When the load-time and the energy-time histories were compared with the fractographics, it was found that fiber breakage had occurred prior to the major damage. When the impact energy increased over the threshold energy of the major damage, matrix cracking, delamination, and fiber breakage were observed at the back surface, below a nearly undamaged zone, which were attributed to the bending stresses. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Metallic sandwich panels with prismatic cores offer the potential for superior blast resistance relative to monolithic plates of equivalent areal density. However, under sufficiently high impulse, severe plastic strains can occur at the junctions of the face sheets and the core members shortly after arrival of the pres- sure wave but prior to significant deformation elsewhere. The potential consequence is localized shear rupture with minimal plastic dissipation. To characterize this failure mode, a combined experimental- numerical protocol has been used to ascertain the plastic strain for dynamic shear rupture of ductile metals. The experimental component involves firing cylindrical projectiles through plates of the targeted materials and monitoring changes in projectile velocity during penetration. With appropriate combina- tions of plate thickness and projectile velocity, penetration occurs through propagation of an annular shear crack. In parallel, a numerical model of dynamic deformation and rupture has been employed to infer the critical strain through comparisons with projectile velocity change measurements. Experiments and analyses have been performed on both 304 stainless steel and superaustenitic AL6XN. Effects of mesh size on the resolution of the predicted strain distribution and the plastic dissipation associated with penetration are addressed.},

For the nth-order reaction the critical regime is modeled by the phase trajectory of the system, which includes the unstable integral manifold. In the autocatalytic case the critical regime is modeled by the mathematical object called duck-trajectory in the modern mathematical literature. Such trajectories pass from the stable integral manifold to the unstable one. Systems' trajectories, passing some part of its way along critical trajectories, belong to the transient regimes. Thus the transient region is separated into the region of slow transient regimes and the region of the explosive transient regimes.

Reflected and radiated acoustic pressure waves were introduced using Taylor's FSI method into Lagrange's equations of motion for the sandwich plate. In comparison to air blast, water-structure interactions diminished deflection and slowed down the response of the sandwich panel for a given pressure pulse loading. The predicted elastic-plastic transient response of the sandwich panel from the analytical model was shown to be fairly consistent results with ABAQUS Explicit. Pressure amplitudes to initiate damage in a sandwich panel with E-glass/Vinyl Ester facesheets and PVC H250 foam core were calculated under water blast/air back, water blast/water back, and air blast/air back conditions. It took significantly higher pressures to initiate damage in the panels under water blast/air back and water blast/water back conditions than in the air blast/air back plate because of fluid damping and higher plastic work dissipation in the core. A parametric study showed that on a per unit areal weight basis, panels with softer, more ductile foams were more blast resistant than panels with strong and stiff cores because of work dissipation during core plasticity. In the water blast cases, foam yielding was affected by transverse compression and not only transverse shear, as is usually case in air blast-loaded sandwich panels.},

Cross-stream and streamwise particle imaging velocimetry measurements were used to relate flow field modification to sound field changes measured by far-field microphones in the overexpanded, ideally expanded, and underexpanded regimes. Drastic modification of the jet cross-section was achieved by the investigated configurations, with both elliptic and triangular shapes attained downstream. Consequently, screech was nearly eliminated with reductions in the range of 10-25 dB depending on the operating condition. Analysis of the streamwise velocity indicated that both the mean shock spacing and strength were reduced resulting in an increase in the broadband shock associated noise spectral peak frequency and a reduction in the amplitude, respectively. Maximum broadband shock associated noise amplitude reductions were in the 5-7 dB range. Chevron proximity was found to be the primary driver of peak vorticity production, though persistence followed the opposite trend. The integrated streamwise vorticity modulus was found to be correlated with peak large scale turbulent mixing noise reduction, though optimal overall sound pressure level reductions did not necessarily follow due to the shock/fine scale mixing noise sources. Optimal large scale mixing noise reductions were in the 5-6 dB range.},

We consider here the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to enhance the mechanical properties of composite interface layers. The use of CNTs not only enhances the strength of the interface but also significantly alters stress propagation in composite laminates. A simplified wave propagation simulation is developed and the optimal CNT content in the interface layer is determined using multi-objective optimization paradigms. The optimization process targets minimizing the ratio of the stress developed in the layers to the strength of that layer for all the composite laminate layers. Two optimization methods are employed to identify the optimal CNT content. A case study demonstrating the design of five-layer composite laminate subjected to a blast event is used to demonstrate the concept. It is shown that the addition of 2{\%} and 4{\%} CNTs by weight to the epoxy interfaces results in significant enhancement of the composite ability to resist blast. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A method for design of wind turbine airfoils is presented. This method is based on direct numerical optimisation of a B-spline representation of the airfoil shape. The XFOIL is used as flow solver during the optimisation. The generation and the optimisation processes are implemented in MATLAB, and an interface between MATLAB and XFOIL is created. The airfoil profiles are represented by a B-Spline formulation based on 14 control points. The control point distribution, detailed in the present work, is able to reproduce different airfoils with various geometries with a good accuracy (maximal geometry difference less than 0.5{\%}). The design method is demonstrated by the improvement of the MH43 profile performances at different angles of attack under specific conditions: Reynolds number = 3.106 and Mach number = 0.2. First the lift-drag ratio at 2 degrees angle of attack is increased from 93 to 120. Then, lift-drag ratio at 5 degrees angle of attack is increased from 110 to 130. Finally, the lift- drag ratio is increased simultaneously at both angles: 2 and 5 degrees. This results in an increase in performances of the initial MH43 profile over the entire range of angles of attack. Nevertheless, the program is not completed yet. Other validations have to be performed and several parameters still have to be implemented.},

abstract = {A constitutive model based on the concept of continuum damage mechanics has been proposed to study the progressive damage behavior of composite laminates under ballistic impact. The proposed model is investigated in five steps: First, the quadratic form of damage initiation criteria are presented to predict the initiation of failure in different modes. Second, an exponential form damage evolution law combined with characteristic length based fracture energy approach has been presented. Stiffness degradation is characterized by a variable determined by the equivalent displacement for each failure mode. Third, an experimentally verified strain rate model that considers the rate dependency of the strength and modulus of the composite laminate is considered. Fourth, cohesive elements are inserted at every inter-layer for modeling the delamination evolution. Fifth, the constitutive model has been combined with an element erosion algorithm for the removal of highly distorted elements. Simulations have been performed using reduced integration hexahedra elements (RIHE) and full integration hexahedra elements (FIHE). Implementation of cohesive elements exhibited better delamination progression. Experimentally verified strain rate model enhanced the efficiency of the model showing good correlation between the present simulations and experimental observations, in terms of damage patterns, residual velocity, kinetic energy and ballistic limit.},

abstract = {This paper presents an experimental study on the impact behaviour of composite laminates made of a Dyneema{\textregistered} woven fabric and four different resin matrices. Three thicknesses of each kind of resin laminate were subjected to impact by a spherical steel projectile in a velocity regime ranging from 100 to 200 m/s. The results revealed that the laminates having flexible matrices performed much better in perforation resistance and energy absorption, but had a greater extent of deformation and damage than the counterparts with rigid matrices. It was found that the matrix rigidity played a crucial role in controlling the propagation of transverse deformation, and thereby the local strain and perforation resistance of laminates. The more rigid matrix restrained the laminate's transverse deformation to a smaller area at a given time, which led to higher local strain and lower perforation resistance. Fibre failure in tension was identified as the dominant failure mechanism for the tested laminates.},

The influence of the loading and material parameters on the final deformation characteristics is examined. Particular attention is paid to the transient deformation process by using finite element and analytical models to analyse the panel behaviour. It is shown that the response of the FML panels is extremely sensitive to the spatial and temporal distribution variation of the pressure caused by the blast loading. The study reveals that the properties of GFPP in the through-thickness direction play an essential role in the velocity transfer, which influences considerably the failure and final deformed shape of the FML panel. Good agreement between the experimental and numerical results is observed. Comparisons between the responses of relatively thin FML panels, monolithic aluminium alloy plates of equivalent mass and a foam-core panel to localised blast are also presented and discussed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, The Author(s) 2017. In this study, the continuum damage mechanics model for predicting the stiffness reduction of composite laminates including transverse cracks is formulated as a function of crack density. To formulate the model, first the damage variable in the direction normal to the fiber of a ply including transverse cracks is derived. The damage variable is derived by the model assuming a plane strain field in the isotropic plane and using the Gudmundson–Zang model for comparison. The effective compliance based on the strain equivalent principle proposed by Murakami et al. and classical laminate theory are then used to formulate the elastic moduli of laminates of arbitrary lay-up configurations as a function of the damage variable. Finally, the results obtained from this model are compared to the finite-element analysis reported in previous studies. The model proposed in this paper can predict the stiffness of laminates containing damage due to transverse cracks (or surface crack) from just the mechanical properties of a ply and the lay-up configurations. Furthermore, this model can precisely predict the finite-element analysis results and experiment results for the elastic moduli of the laminate of arbitrary lay-up configuration, such as cross-ply, angle ply, and quasi-isotropic, including transverse cracks. This model only considers the damage of the transverse crack; it does not consider damage such as delamination. However, this model seems to be effective in the early stage of damage formation when transverse cracking mainly occurs. The model assuming plane strain field in the isotropic plane which is proposed in this paper can calculate the local stress distribution in a ply including transverse cracks as a function of crack density. The damage evolution of transverse cracks can thus be simulated by determining the fracture criterion.},

abstract = {Aerospace composites are exposed to low temperatures that induce high levels of stress within the material. This is sufficient to induce fractures and eventually delaminations and failure. Thus, understanding how these temperature induced translaminar fractures can be reduced is an important area of research. This work investigates cross-ply unidirectional (UD) and woven (W) carbon fibre laminates with MTM46 epoxy to assess how the cure schedule (low temperature, LTC and high temperature, HTC) effect temperature driven fractures. A novel digital image correlation technique was applied to determine in-situ fracture progression versus temperature. Thermal techniques investigated the degree of cure, resin plasticity, thermal expansion and beta transition effects. The cure schedule for carbon epoxy laminates has a marked effect on quantity of manufacturing induced fractures and the temperature at which temperature induced internal fracture occurs. This work has demonstrated that a lower temperature cure is more robust against temperature driven fracture despite having a larger coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and similar levels of plasticity. Low temperatures induce high internal stresses but the residual stress resulting from high temperature cure is of greater concern. DIC is an excellent method to determine onset and progression of translaminar fracture as well as the behaviour of composite materials subject to temperature effects. This work is of great benefit when considering the design of CFRP structures subject to low temperature loading, furthermore the data can be used to more accurately model this phenomena in future.},

The results of drilling tests showed that the thrust force (Ft), torque, and delamination factor are increased with increasing feed and vice versa for the induced temperature. Drilling of GFRE composites at lower speed (16.3 m/min) result in lower temperature rise, higher thrust force, higher torque and accordingly, higher delamination factor compared with that drilled at 65.3 m/min. Drilling at temperature close to glass transition temperature is useful for reducing Ft, delamination and thus obtaining better bearing strength compared with drilling at lower temperature levels. The critical thrust force at the onset of push-out delamination was predicted for different uncut layers, in front ‎of the drill chisel edge, using some analytical models.‎ For the first time, in drilling [0°]8woven composites, the [ABD] stiffness matrices was effectively ‎represented by [0°/90°]4scross-ply laminate with the advantages that the elastic properties were determined by the rule of mixtures (no need to perform ‎mechanical tests).},

@article{Iannucci2006,
abstract = {The design of composite structures or components, subject to extreme loading conditions, such as crash, blast, etc. requires a fundamental understanding of the deterioration mechanism within the composite meso-structure. Existing predictive techniques for the analysis of composite structures and components near and beyond their ultimate strength are either based on simple scalar stress functions, or use very complex damage formulations with many material constants, some of which may be difficult to characterise. This paper presents a simple damage mechanics based progressive failure model for thin woven carbon composites under impact loading. The approach is based on an unconventional thermodynamic maximum energy dissipation approach, which entails controlling damage evolution and hence energy dissipation per second, rather than damage. The method has been implemented into the explicit dynamic finite element code DYNA3D. Numerical simulation results using the proposed model are compared with two experimental impact tests. The analysis methodology proposed in this paper reflects a very simple, but effective technique that can be used to model a wide range of problems from extreme events, such as crash or blast, to birdstrike, when tearing and perforation are major failure mechanisms. As damage is cumulative, the technique allows initial or/and post-impact static loads to be applied to the composite structure or component, thus allowing a cradle-to-grave design methodology. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

For ball velocity under three machine speed settings, the measured data between dry and wet ball showed a difference in magnitude but with similar consistency. The optimal wheel pressure to produce the best dry ball velocity among those tested was 6.25 psi. The effect of speed ratio on the ball velocity was also observed from the measured velocity data where the ball velocity increase, as wheel's rotational velocity increases, peaked at 2000 rpm before decreasing. From the comparison between measured bowling length and line to that of calculations, the suitable drag coefficient value was 0.4 for estimating the ball trajectory. From the analysis, ball wetness, wheel pressure, and speed ratio were determined to be important in evaluating the performance of the cricket bowling machine.},

However, OB/OD effects a variety of hazardous damages to environment. Therefore, using incinerators to treat expired explosives is required instead of OB/OD. To guarantee the safety of these demilitarization methods, the blast wave of the explosives should be previously recognized to evaluate the impact of detonations. Although various materials are used to produce explosives, most researches have focused on trinitrotoluene (TNT). Other representative explosives such as research department explosives (RDX) and high melting explosives (HMX) are seldom studied in the literature. Therefore, our aim was to understand the blast wave of three materials under different geometry throughout simulations. To improve accuracy and reduce computational time, a zoning technique with Euler-Lagrange coupling method was used. Due to limitations and difficulties of detonation experiments, simulations were verified by theoretical models. In case of semi-confined bunker, the simulation results were compared with experimental data, showing a close match. As a result, cylinder type is the safest incinerator among semi-confined bunker, cylinder, and cube incinerators, in terms of the blast wave.},

abstract = {A theoretical study is performed herein on the perforation of fibre-reinforced plastic laminates subjected to impact by flat-nosed projectiles in a wide range of velocities. Ballistic impact on FRP laminates is a very complex problem and it can be generally classified into two categories, i.e. global deformation with local rupture and wave-dominated local failure. Simple analytical models for both global deformation failure as well as wave-dominated local failure are first given, and a shear failure criterion is employed to predict the perforation of FRP laminates which fail in global deformation mode. By combining the wave-dominated local failure model and the concept of Von Karman's critical impact velocity, a condition for the transition of the above mentioned two failure modes is obtained. It is shown that the model predictions are in good agreement with available experimental observations in terms of ballistic limits and critical conditions for the transition of failure modes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Various configurations including monolithic and multi-layered plate having combinations of ceramic, metal and composite material layers are investigated to determine the critical failure velocity Vcfas a function of layer thickness and stacking. While cylindrical impactor is assumed to be rigid, Johnson-Cook (JC), Johnson-Holmquist (JH2) and Hashin 3D and Puck criteria is used to characterize damage/failure in metal (Al and steel), ceramic (SiC) and composite (carbon fiber/epoxy) layer respectively. Constitutive equations for composite material are supplied via user subroutine VUMAT. The results of FEM simulations reveal that Ceramic-Al-Carbon fiber/epoxy multilayer plate provides most desirable combination with higher critical failure velocity, lower average density, lower pressure and displacement at the back plate as compared to other material combinations considered in this work. Moreover, the analysis presented shows that the numerical approach developed can be used as a tool to predict the geometry and material combinations of a multilayer system to improve its resistance against impact loading.},

abstract = {In this paper, a series of impact tests were conducted to investigate the ballistic performance of monolithic and multi-layered metal plates subjected to impact by blunt rigid projectiles. Layered plates arranged in various combinations of equivalent total thickness were normally impacted at different velocities by a gas gun. Ballistic limit velocity for each configuration target was obtained based on the investigation of the effect of the air gap between layers, the number, order and thickness of layers on the ballistic resistance. The results showed that the monolithic targets were more effective than layered targets when the dominant response of monolithic targets was dishing which involved membrane stretching, and the ballistic limit velocities of layered plates decreased with the increase of the number of layers. Conversely, the monolithic targets had lower ballistic limit velocities than layered targets if total thickness above a specific value that the dominant response of monolithic targets was shearing. Moreover, the air gap significantly affected the ballistic resistance of spaced layered plates. Layered targets with larger air gap were stronger than those with small air gap, and also there were two ballistic limit velocities in the former configuration. On the other hand, as the order of layers affected the ballistic resistance of double-layered targets, the ballistic resistance was better when the first layer was thicker than the second layer.

abstract = {This chapter describes a micromechanical prediction procedure to simulate the progressive failure strength of a composite laminate subjected to multiaxial loading. Essentially, two steps are observed in the simulation of a multidirectional laminate. The chapter explains the first step in which a laminate analysis is performed using the classical lamination theory. The purpose of the laminate analysis is to obtain the in-plane strain and curvature increments of the laminate and further to determine the stresses sheared by each lamina in the laminate. The most important quantity involved in this step analysis is the instantaneous stiffness matrix of the lamina, which will be used to construct the laminate overall stiffness matrix. A recently developed micromechanics model, the bridging model, is used to define this instantaneous stiffness matrix and to relate the stress increments in the constituent fiber and resin materials of the lamina with those stress increments exerted on it. The thermal residual stresses generated in the constituents because of mismatch between the coefficients of thermal expansion in the fiber and resin materials are addressed and have been incorporated in the analysis. As long as one of the constituents attains its ultimate stress state, the lamina is considered to have failed and its contribution to the overall stiffness matrix of the laminate is reduced. The chapter presents a total reduction strategy. In this way, the progressive failure process in the laminate can be understood and the corresponding failure mode can be identified automatically. A generalized maximum normal stress criterion is adopted to detect the constituent failure. The prediction procedure has been applied to 14 different composite laminates, where failure envelopes or stress-strain curves up to final failure subjected to biaxial loading are required. The predicted results are reported in figures and data tables.},

A simple and effective cryogenic device was applied to the SHPB system to create the low-temperature field of the samples. It was found that the compression modulus, peak stress, failure strain and specific energy absorption of the 3-D braided basalt/epoxy composite materials had different sensitivity to temperatures and strain rates. In the out-of-plane impact, there were two failure modes, namely, compression-failure mode and shear-failure mode. Fracture of fiber tows was irregular with abundant pull-out of fiber and much finely-divided fragmentation of resin among fibers at room temperature. In cryogenic field, the fracture of fiber tows was neat and tidy with few pull-out of fiber and few finely-divided fragmentation of resin. However, in the in-plane impact, there was only compression failure mode. And there was no fracture of fiber tows and no big difference among samples tested under different gas pressures. Because of the function of squeezing and buckling, split-off separation of the composite could be blocked by the tangled fiber tows. As a whole, the reinforcement could still keep its structural integrity.},

abstract = {Impacts of foreign objects on composite structures can create internal damage that reduces the strength of the structure significantly. The study of such impacts requires understanding the dynamics of the event, predicting the extent of the induced damage, and estimating the residual properties of the structure. The impact event involves the motion of the target, the motion of the projectile, and the local indentation in the contact zone. A large number of parameters affect the impact dynamics, many types of responses can be obtained, and many models have been proposed in the literature. These models can be classified into three categories: (1) energy-balance models that assume a quasi-static behavior of the structure; (2) spring-mass models that account for the dynamics of the structure in a simplified manner; (3) complete models in which the dynamic behavior of the structure is fully modeled. Simple models can bring insight into the problem and be efficient but have limited applicability. Complex models may have wider applicability but require significantly higher modeling and computational effort. There is a need for a general understanding of the impact dynamics and for a method for developing efficient and accurate models. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The tensile strength of particle reinforced elastomeric composites (PRECs) was studied as functions of the particle volume content (loading) and particle size. The measured tensile strength increased with increasing particle loading and decreased with increasing particle size. The measured fracture toughness increased with increasing particle size. A fracture mechanical model to predict the tensile strength was developed to better understand the reinforcing effects of the particle and to provide a criterion for a better composite. Using a body center cubic (BCC) crystal system, the elastic energies of the undamaged and damaged cells were obtained. The tensile strength as a function of the measured fracture toughness (J value) and the modulus of the matrix can be calculated by comparing the energies. The predicted tensile strength decreased with increasing particle size in a similar manner to the experimental results. The analytical model predicted that the size of the poor interface up to 30° of the debonded angle on the tensile strength becomes less severe as the particle size is decreased. In addition, the specimen with smaller particles ({\textless}30 µm) should have a higher tensile strength than that of the experimentally measured values. The conglomeration and non-uniform distribution of smaller particles, and the entrapped void within the agglomerates while mixing and fabricating can be one reason.},

abstract = {Abstract Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) laminates are used extensively in naval ships at risk from underwater explosive blasts. This chapter presents an experimental investigation to determine the effect of dynamic loading from underwater shock waves on damage to GFRP laminates. Two types of GFRP laminates were studied with a relatively low (29{\%}) or high (41{\%}) volume content of E-glass fibers, representative of naval materials made using two manufacturing processes. The GFRP laminates were subjected to shock waves of increasing intensity by increasing the mass and/or reducing the standoff distance of the explosive charge. Blast damage to the laminates initiated with fiber–matrix interfacial cracking and matrix cracking, although a higher shock wave pressure was required to initiate this damage in the composite with the higher fiber content. Blast loading also caused the initiation and growth of delamination cracks; and again the laminate with the higher fiber content displayed superior damage resistance. The laminates eventually ruptured due to fracture of the glass fibers and plies, with the composite with the higher fiber content requiring a greater shock wave pressure to cause complete fracture. Due to the superior blast damage resistance of the laminate with the higher fiber content, the postblast mechanical properties were higher than the composite with the low fiber content.},

Rectangular clamped plates with rivet-attached stiffeners were used as a basic model of the fuselage skin of a commercial aircraft. Both non-pressurized and pre-pressurized plates (static pressure of 41.4 kPa) were considered to simulate the typical in-flight loads experienced by a commercial aircraft due to cabin pressurization. This work extends previous research on blast loading of pre-pressurized plates [Veldman RL, Ari-Gur J, Clum C, DeYoung A, Folkert J. Effects of pre-pressurization on blast response of clamped aluminum plates. Int J Impact Eng 2006;32(10):1678-95] to incorporate the effects of riveted stiffeners. An experimental system was designed using a vacuum vessel to apply a pressure differential to the reinforced test plate. Bare spherical explosive charges of C4 were then detonated at fixed distances from the plate. The permanent plate deformations or the amount of tearing in the plates were measured for 17 explosive tests with two different blast load intensities. A high-speed camera was used to determine the mechanism and time scale of failure propagation in the reinforced panels. A comparison of permanent plate deformations and damage showed two distinct results. For the least intense blast load case, both the non-pressurized and pressurized panels deformed but did not tear. In this scenario, very little effect of pre-pressurization on final panel deformation was noted. For the more intense blast load case, a significant increase in panel damage (plate tearing) was observed as static pre-pressurization increased from 0.0 to 41.4 kPa. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The key utility of computer simulations comes from their ability to solve complex systems of equations that are either intractable with analytic techniques or only amenable to highly approximative treatments. Simulations are best viewed as a powerful complement to analytic reasoning, and as the method of choice to model systems that feature enormous physical complexity such as star formation in evolving galaxies, the topic of this 43rd Saas Fee Advanced Course. The organizers asked me to lecture about high performance computing and numerical modelling in this winter school, and to specifically cover the basics of numerically treating gravity and hydrodynamics in the context of galaxy evolution. This is still a vast field, and I necessarily had to select a subset of the relevant material. The written notes presented here quite closely follow the lectures as held in Villars-sur-Ollon, which were meant to provide a general overview about some of the most pertinent techniques that may be relevant for students working on numerical models of galaxy evolution and star formation. The discussion is hence often at an introductory level, giving precedence to a presentation of the main numerical concepts rather than to a mathematically detailed exposition of the techniques.},

Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the material characterization parameters can be extracted from the results of standard test methodologies for which a large body of published data already exists for many composite materials. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive experimental study of the effect of ply orientation on the ballistic performance of the multi-ply fabric panels. The fabric panels used in the experiments were constructed by laying plies of plain-woven fabrics in a selection of orientations. Particular attention was paid to the stacking sequence of fabrics with different laying angles. Ballistic impact tests were carried out on such angled fabric panels. The results showed significant improvement in energy-absorbing capacity of the angled multi-ply panel over the conventional aligned panel where all fabric plies are laid in the same orientation. The impact energy absorption by these angled fabric panels showed a 14{\%} increase over the aligned counterpart, depending on the number of the plies. Optimizing the stacking sequence of the angled plies caused a 15{\%} increase in impact energy absorption. For the panels with a large number of plies, such as the eight-ply panels, the effective panel construction can be determined according to the performance of the sub-level ply group.},

abstract = {In this investigation, fiber-reinforced composite plates subjected to low velocity impact are studied by the use of finite element analysis (FE). Mindlin's plate theory is implemented into the FE approach in which a 9-node Lagrangian element is considered. Dynamic stress analysis is carried out by the use of a constitutive equation of composite laminates without damage. A parametric analysis shows that the increase in the percentage of the 90° plies increases the contact force implying a reduction in the rigidity of the laminate. Stresses are calculated at nine Gaussian points of each element of each interface and then averaged. At first, threshold velocities are evaluated for different stacking sequence to predict matrix crack initiation. Then, the impact induces damage at a higher impact velocity including matrix cracking is predicted by the appropriate failure criteria. The present results indicate that matrix cracking appears in the upper 90° plies with the dominance of transverse shear stress. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A chronological review of test methods for damping estimation is presented in order to describe the time-line of the theoretical knowledge development in this field. In the last years many new material configurations have emerged that deserve investigation, such as nano-composites, hybrid laminates and sandwich materials. Damping models specifically meant for non-homogeneous materials are reported to provide a background for understanding this problem. Although not widely exploited yet, fibre reinforced polymers has the potential to be tailored for damping by acting on constituents, geometry and boundary conditions. Nano-composites, for instance, are shown to possess a high potential for damping purposes. New hybrid and sandwich-type structures are emerging as noise and vibration control solutions in lightweight applications. The effort devoted to mathematical and numerical model in view of Finite Element integration of damping properties is also addressed. Finally, the conclusions summarise the ideas of the authors on needed steps to advance the state-of-the-art in each of the described topic.},

abstract = {The ballistic performance of monolithic and multi-layered in contact and spaced mild steel target plates has been studied at normal and oblique impact against 7.62 AP projectiles with an objective to ascertain the effect of angle of obliquity. Numerical simulations have been performed on ABAQUS/Explicit finite element code and typical results obtained have been validated by earlier experimental results, Gupta and Madhu [1,2]. The Johnson–Cook elasto-viscoplastic material model calibrated by the authors for mild steel was employed in the numerical simulations. Close correlation of typical experimental and numerical results validated the numerical procedure and the calibrated model. Ballistic limits of monolithic mild steel targets of thicknesses 4.7, 6, 10, 12 and 16 mm each impacted at 0, 30 and 45ᵒ obliquity were numerically computed. The ballistic limits of in contact layered and spaced targets of equivalent thickness 10 mm (3.33 + 3.33 + 3.33 mm) were also computed at 0, 30 and 45° obliquity. For 60° angle of obliquity, the monolithic target experienced project ricochet, in contact layered target, projectile embedment, and the spaced target, projectile perforation. At low angles of obliquity, the difference between the ballistic performance of monolithic, layered in contact and spaced targets was not significant. As the angle of obliquity increased, each studied configuration was found to have distinct ballistic performance. Simulations were also done for three layered target of 4.7 and 6 mm thick plate and spacing was varied to study its effect on their ballistic resistance. The variation of spacing at normal impact was found to have influence as long as the spacing was smaller than the projectile length.},

Then, the shape functions can be determined by using the stress continuity conditions between interfaces and the stress boundaries on surfaces. By using the generalized variational principle, the thermal postbuckling equilibrium equations of fiber-metal laminated plates including interfacial damage are established. Finally, the thermal postbuckling problem is solved by adopting finite difference method and iteration method.

Currently published mesh-regularisation strategies can produce mesh-size-independent impact results for a very limited range of mesh-sizes. The originality of the model presented in this paper is based on a novel mesh-regularisation strategy, which is applicable to predicting mesh-size-independent impact results for any target discretisation. Accurate modelling of composites' impact damage using a relatively coarse mesh, and thus at a much reduced computational cost when compared to existing techniques, can be achieved with the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

To be applied as impact tests there exist a variety of quasi- static tests, dynamic impact tests and highly dynamic impact tests. This work aims to show different design possibilities for impact test equipment of each type, to numerically analyze their potential and to evaluate the expected quality of the results of an application of said impact tests to ballistic threat experiments. The obtained results and conclusions from the studied literature and the conducted calculations show two answers about the material testing for impact properties. One is that the impact velocity has a significant influence on the impact force, also when considering the impact energy as constant. Therefore, it is recommendable to apply an experimental test that matches the simulated situation in impact energy and velocity. Second, the calculations have shown that it is possible to build a simple one-stage light-gas gun to achieve an exact replication of level III or level IV ballistic threats and therefore carry through precise testing, if utilizing a light-weight carrier as sabot. The usage of a sabot also provides an increased flexibility to the facility to test different bodies as impacting force on sample material.},

abstract = {This paper describes a methodology for the direct calculation of noise from realistic nozzle geometries. The focus of the paper is on the numerical approach to this problem to provide noise predictions to engineering accuracy in an efficient manner. In addition, issues related to grid generation are discussed. The methodology uses structured multiblock grids. The block surrounding the jet centerline has a Cartesian form and the surrounding grid blocks have a cylindrical polar form - at least for nearly axisymmetric jet nozzle geometries. Appropriate block interface conditions are used. In the case of military style jet nozzles the nozzles are not smooth in the azimuthal direction but have facets representative of the movable flaps in such variable area nozzles. These features must be included in the grid. To enable efficient calculations, in addition to parallel computation, a dual time-stepping approach is used. The sub-iterations in the fictitious time are accelerated using a two-level multigrid approach. A Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) approach based on the Spalart-Allmaras (S-A) one-equation turbulence model is used. Comparisons are made between flow predictions using the DES with the S-A model everywhere and with the turbulence model turned off in the jet external flow. Noise predictions are made with the permeable surface Ffowcs Williams - Hawkings (FW-H) solution. Noise predictions are presented for both a smooth convergent-divergent nozzle as well as a nozzle representative of a military aircraft engine.

abstract = {This paper presents the development of a constitutive model able to accurately represent the full non-linear mechanical response of polymer-matrix fibre-reinforced composites with unidirectional (UD) plies under quasi-static loading. This is achieved by utilising an elasto-plastic modelling framework. The model captures key features that are often neglected in constitutive modelling of UD composites, such as the effect of hydrostatic pressure on both the elastic and non-elastic material response, the effect of multiaxial loading and dependence of the yield stress on the applied pressure. The constitutive model includes a novel yield function which accurately represents the yielding of the matrix within a unidirectional fibre-reinforced composite by removing the dependence on the stress in the fibre direction. A non-associative flow rule is used to capture the pressure sensitivity of the material. The experimentally observed translation of subsequent yield surfaces is modelled using a non-linear kinematic hardening rule. Furthermore, evolution laws are proposed for the non-linear hardening that relate to the applied hydrostatic pressure. Multiaxial test data is used to show that the model is able to predict the non-linear response under complex loading combinations, given only the experimental response from two uniaxial tests. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The present model comprises mainly of two parts. First, quadratic strain based failure criteria are presented to predict the initiation of failure modes. Second, the post damage softening behavior and degradation of the material stiffness is measured by damage evolution law. The model has been implemented within ABAQUS/Explicit as a user defined subroutine VUMAT. The validity of the model has been carried out by performing computational analysis of different composite armor materials such as Kevlar 29 and Kevlar 129 impacting with cylindrical-hemispherical nosed and 120° conical projectiles. It transpires that the predictions from the present model are in good agreement with the experimental and numerical observations available in the literature in terms of back face signature (BFS) for both the targets and projectiles. Further, the model has been implemented to study the effect of projectile geometry on the velocity time histories of the projectile, residual velocity and ballistic limit velocity. BFS values showed good agreement for conical projectile while for hemispherical projectile it is slightly low. The combination of Kevlar 129 armor and hemispherical projectile shows higher ballistic limit compared to that of the other combinations.},

The crack initiation and propagation energies, when the loading direction was parallel to the initial rolling direction, decreased with increasing thickness ranges from 0.25 to 1 mm. The changes of size, shape and distribution of dimples with increasing thickness confirmed the restriction of deformation systems and the development of triaxial stress state and plane-strain condition at the notch tip. However, in transverse-directed specimens, the energy release rate increased with increasing specimen thickness up to 0.75 mm and then decreased.

abstract = {In the present study the estimation of the blast wave by two types of finite element methods is investigated: Eulerian multi-material modeling and pure Lagrangian. The main goal is to compare and study their ability to predict the clearing effect during blast. Element shape and improvements on the codes are also considered. For the Lagrangian finite element models the load is applied by using an empirical method, deriving from databases, for the time-spatial distribution of the pressure profiles. In the ideal case of the above method the blast load is applied as an equivalent triangular pulse to represent the decay of the incident and reflected pressure. The implementation of this method in LS-DYNA is improved and takes a more realistic approach, assuming an exponential decay of the pressure with time. In the case of the Eulerian models the influence of the shape of elements and its influence on the incident and reflected pressure in three types of simulations, using rectangular, cylindrical and spherical grid of air, were investigated. An analytical method to predict impulse is used to compare with the numerical and experimental results. The Eulerian models provide results closer to the experimental. Specifi-cally, the cylindrical grid of air gives better results in comparison with the other methods.},

abstract = {The corrosion of reinforcement (rebar) in concrete members is one of the governing factors deteriorating the load carrying capacity of concrete members. Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) has been the subject of much interest from researchers and engineers due to its enhanced durability and non-corrosive characteristics. Corrosion problems in reinforced concrete (RC) members can be resolved through the use of FRP rebar as its reinforcement. In order to expand usage of FRP rebar, rebar with various shapes and sizes has been developed and manufactured for RC structures. However, currently, a limited number of FRP rebar selections are available on the market. The obstacles preventing the wider application of FRP rebar are the relatively high price of FRP rebar compared to steel rebar and insufficient design guidelines for various FRP rebars sold in the market. Since there is a wide variety of unstandardized FRP rebar sold in the market, the application of these rebars in concrete structural design must be carefully conducted by modifying related coefficients and safety factors to assure the safety of the designed structures. Therefore, the enhancement of the performance of FRP rebar by means of efficient manufacturing methods would reduce its cost and increase its usage. Sufficient tensile and bonding strengths are necessary properties of rebar. However, depending on the material and shape of FRP rebar, these properties vary significantly. This study focuses on the tensile performance of rebar realized through enhancements in its constituent materials and manufacturing processes. Constituent materials and manufacturing processes were thoroughly researched and evaluated to maximize the tensile performance. A total of six factors affecting the tensile and bonding capacities of FRP rebar were modified in the study. For the new FRP rebar, a higher target with a guaranteed tensile strength of 900 MPa and a 78{\%} fiber volume fraction by weight, manufactured using E-glass fiber TEX 4400, was chosen. The verification study results showed that the new glass FRP (GFRP) rebar showed better material properties than other types of GFRP rebar currently available on the market.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, The Author(s) 2018. This paper is concerned with a theoretical and experimental verification of a micromechanical model of newly developed sandwich panels denoted as 3D integrated woven sandwich composite panels. The integrated hollow core was made of a pile of 3D bars with a special configuration. Integrated woven sandwich composite panels consist of two fabric faces which were interwoven by pile fibers and therefore a very high skin core debonding resistance was obtained. With the objective of qualifying the mechanical properties of these structures, fairly extensive experimental research was carried out by investigators. Although some numerical methods have been developed to predict the mechanical behaviors of these structures, there are less analytical models in this area. Due to the computational difficulties and the time consuming nature of the finite element method, in the present study, a new micromechanics analytical model has been suggested for predicting the compressive strength of integrated woven sandwich composites. In order to evaluate the proposed model, fabricated samples with different pile heights and pile distribution densities were subjected to flatwise compression tests. The results show that compressive properties of integrated woven sandwich composite panels are decreased with the increase of core heights and increased greatly with that of the pile density. Furthermore, the micromechanics model reasonably predicted the compression strength, and there is a good agreement between the experimental data and model predictions.},

Three such projectiles used in this study were designated according to their front and second nose shapes as conico-blunt, blunt-blunt and blunt-conico. Each projectile was hit normally on 0.82 and 1.82 mm thick circular plate targets of 1100-H14 aluminium at different velocities. The deformation, failure mode and ballistic limit of both targets were obtained through experiments and reproduced through simulations using ABAQUS/Explicit finite element code. The ballistic limit of target was found to be highest against blunt-blunt followed by conico-blunt and blunt-conico projectile respectively. The results of target response thus obtained due to the impact of the double-nosed projectiles were compared with those of the single-nosed blunt and conical projectiles, and typical features of the plate response have been discussed for both double and single-nosed projectiles. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A bottom-up multiscale virtual testing strategy is presented to take into account the physical mechanisms of deformation at different length scales on the behaviour of the composite. Starting from the microscale, the contributions of the basic constituents, microstructure and loading conditions to the mechanical response are considered in a rigorous way. This hierarchical multiscale approach describes systematically the material behaviour at different length scales from ply to laminate to component level, allowing the determination of ply properties, laminate characteristics and structural response. Additionally, this approach easily allows consideration of changes in properties of the constituents (fibre, matrices), fibre architecture or laminate lay-up and provides fast predictions of their influences on the macroscopic behaviour of composite structures. Hence, this approach constitutes a promising tool to provide significant efficiency gains in the design, testing and certification of composite aircraft structures.},

The effects of strain rate on the strength as well as the modulus of fiber reinforced plastic laminated materials are also considered in the model.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht. Precision-guided projectiles (PGPs) typically deployed in smart munitions are operated and guided by highly sophisticated embedded electronic systems (EES). These PGPs are subjected to severe shock loads resulting from the ignition of the propellant during their launch. These shock loads, which are typically characterised by high intensity, short duration and wave reflections at varied frequencies, often lead to the failure of the EES. It is the objective of this work to conduct a comprehensive multiphysics analysis of the launch process of PGPs accounting for coupling and interaction effects between the different media (propellant, PGP, confined volume and free space). Specifically, we investigated the entire launch process that include the ignition of the propellant to observe local and global features of the setback, set forward pressure and acceleration histories using explicit axisymmetric Lagrangian–Eulerian finite element simulations. In this work, we also examine the severity and frequency of the reflected waves as well as the springback of the PGPs resulting from these local oscillations as they exit the muzzle. In addition, the flight state transition due to muzzle exit in terms of pressure and flow velocity is also discussed. Our results reveal the complex phenomena associated with the dynamic response of the PGPs and pressurization process resulting from the ignition of propellant during launch that are characterized by high oscillatory pressure profiles and projectile springback.},

However, a few of them such as GNT (Gurson, Tvergaard and Needleman) and JohnsonCook models have gained wide application in the simulations. The models involve a number of constants to be determined normally by experiment in which void development in the specimen must be considered. This is usually a hard task and the results are always questionable. In this investigation a combined experimental, numerical and optimization technique is employed for identification of the constants of Johnson-Cook material and damage model. The experiments are conducted at low to high strain rate regimes using standard testing devices such Instron and high rate apparatuses such as "Flying Wedge". The experiments are simulated using the same specimen geometries and the apparatus. The simulations are carried out using the commercial codes, Ls-dyna. The differences between the deformed shapes of the specimens from the experiments and those predicted from the numerical simulations are taken as the objective function for optimization purposes.

However, it is necessary to adapt the processes and/or tooling as the risk of delamination, or other damages, is high. These problems can affect mechanical properties of produced parts, therefore, lower reliability. In this paper, four different drills - three commercial and a special step (prototype) - are compared in terms of thrust force during drilling and delamination. In order to evaluate damage, enhanced radiography is applied. The resulting images were then computational processed using a previously developed image processing and analysis platform. Results show that the prototype drill had encouraging results in terms of maximum thrust force and delamination reduction. Furthermore, it is possible to state that a correct choice of drill geometry, particularly the use of a pilot hole, a conservative cutting speed - 53 m/min - and a low feed rate - 0.025 mm/rev - can help to prevent delamination. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The properties vary markedly with temper; those in T3 and T4 type tempers are noteworthy for their high toughness, while T6 and T8 type tempers have very high strength. This alloy has excellent properties and creep resistance at elevated temperatures. The T6 and T8 type tempers have very high resistance to corrosion. However, as shown in Table 3.1.2.3.1(a), 2024-T3, -T4, and -T42 rolled plate, rod and bar, and extruded shapes and 2024-T6 and -T62 forgings have a 'D' SCC rating. This is the lowest rating and means that SCC failures have occurred in service or would be anticipated if there is any sustained stress. In-service failures are caused by stresses produced by any combination of sources including solution heat treatment, straightening, forming, fit-up, clamping, sustained service loads or high service compression stresses that produce residual tensile stresses. These stresses may be tension or compression as well as the stresses due to the Poisson effect, because the actual failures are caused by the resulting sustained shear stresses. Pin-hole flaws in corrosion protection are sufficient for SCC. The weldability of the alloy is discussed in Section 3.1.3.4. The properties of extrusions should be based upon the thickness at the time of quenching prior to machining. Selection of the mechanical properties based upon its final machined thickness may be unconservative; therefore, the thickness at the time of quenching to achieve properties is an important factor in the selection of the proper thickness column. For extrusions having sections with various thicknesses, consideration should be given to the properties as a function of thickness. Material specifications for 2024 are presented in Table 3.2.3.0(a). Room-temperature mechanical properties are shown in Tables 3.2.3.0(b) through (j 2). The effect of temperature on the physical properties of this alloy is shown in Figure 3.2.3.0.},

To analyze these laminates, the finite element method based on shear deformation theory is used. The Tsai-Hill failure criterion is taken as the fitness function, and the ply orientation angles are the design variables. In the GA, tournament selection and the uniform crossover method are used. The elitist model is also used for an effective evolution strategy and the creeping random search method is adopted in order to approach the solution with high accuracy. Optimization results are given for various loading and boundary conditions.

abstract = {This paper investigates the blast response of fibre-metal laminates (FMLs) manufactured from two glass fibre reinforced polypropylene composites and that of a plain aluminium alloy. The FMLs were manufactured by stacking the materials in a mould and applying heat and pressure to them. An autoclave was not used. In this work, attention focuses on elucidating the failure modes in the hybrid laminates. The blast data is non-dimensionalised to develop an empirical formula that characterises the behaviour of these materials under this extreme form of loading. The results indicate that thermoplastic-based FML materials may show potential for use in blast-resistant structures, due to their ability to absorb blast energy through delamination, debonding between the aluminium and composite layers, spalling/petalling of the aluminium, perforation through the layers and bending and stretching of the glass fibres. The tests also highlight the difference in response between panels constructed using woven (symmetrical response) and unidirectional (asymmetric behaviour) GFPP composites. The non-dimensional analysis appears to show that there is correlation between the response of all three panel types. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The penetration of a rifle bullet into a block of ballistic gelatin is experimentally and computationally studied for enhancing our understanding of the damage caused to human soft tissues. The gelatin is modeled as an isotropic and homogeneous elastic-plastic linearly strain-hardening material that obeys a polynomial equation of state. Effects of numerical uncertainties on penetration characteristics are found by repeating simulations with minute variations in the impact speed and the angle of attack. The temporary cavity formed in the gelatin and seen in pictures taken by two high speed cameras is found to compare well with the computed one. The computed time histories of the hydrostatic pressure at points situated 60 mm above the line of impact are found to have "two peaks", one due to the bullet impact and the other due to the bullet tumbling. Contours of the von Mises stress and of the effective plastic strain in the gelatin block imply that a very small region adjacent to the cavity surface is plastically deformed. The angle of attack is found to noticeably affect the penetration depth at the instant of the bullet tumbling through 90°.},

abstract = {Adapting the formulation given by Savin for stresses around holes in anisotropic plates under inplane loading, a general solution is obtained to consider an arbitrary shape of hole and arbitrarily oriented uniaxial, biaxial, and shear stresses at infinity as well as uniform tangential force, and uniform pressure around the hole. This is achieved by introducing a general form of mapping function and an arbitrary biaxial loading condition into the boundary conditions. In addition, the basic formulation is extended for multilayered plates. By introducing into the computer program, the constants of the mapping function, the arbitrary biaxial loading factor, the orientation angle and the complex parameters for the laminate, the stresses around the hole can be easily obtained. This solution is useful to study the effect of the above parameters on stress distribution. To illustrate the usefulness of the solution, results are obtained for various shapes of holes, loading conditions and laminate geometry. Failure strength is determined using different failure criteria. It is noted that the stress distribution around a given a shape of hole depends on the combined effect of hole geometry, type of loading and laminate geometry.},

The principles of linear elastic fracture mechanics are indirectly used by equating, in the case of single-mode delamination, the area underneath the traction/relative displacement curve to the critical energy release rate of the mode under examination. For mixed-mode delamination an interaction model is used which can fulfil various fracture criteria proposed in the literature. It is then shown that the model can be recast in the framework of a more general damage mechanics theory. Numerical results are presented for the analyses of a double cantilever beam specimen and for a problem involving multiple delamination for which comparisons are made with experimental results. Issues related with the numerical solution of the non-linear problem of the delamination are discussed, such as the in uence of the interface strength on the convergence properties and the final results, the optimal choice of the iterative matrix in the predictor and the number of integration points in the interface elements.},

Two cases of multiobjective optimization of plates under transverse or in-plane load are studied. In these examples the minimization of two objectives, such as weight and deflection or weight and cost, are simultaneously performed and a pareto-optimal set is obtained by shifting the optimization emphasis using a weighting factor. The stiffness maximization of a composite shell under pressure load is presented in the last example, where the geometrically nonlinear behavior of the structure is considered.

Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) of E-glass/phenolic and E-glass/epoxy laminates was also carried out. It was observed that, E-glass/phenolic laminates which have shown higher storage and loss modulus were found to show higher energy absorption than E-glass/epoxy laminates which have shown lower storage and loss modulus. This is observed to be because of ease of delamination and transverse stretching of fibres in E-glass/phenolic laminates as the matrix at the interface is allowing easy sliding. However this effect is found to be significant only when the laminate thickness to projectile diameter ratio (t/d) is more than two. Mechanisms influencing the observed trend in results are analyzed in the present paper with the help of DMA and high speed video imaging during impact.

abstract = {Because of the high toughness and flexibility of the fibres, Kevlar-reinforced polymer composites are always difficult to machine, characterised bt poor, fuzzy surface finish with partially pulled-out and crushed fibres. For drilling, tungsten-carbide-reinforced tooling in conjunction with very high rotational speeds are normally suggested. The present paper describes a simple technique of drilling Kevlar composites by using slightly modified high-speed steel (HSS) drill bits at commonly available rotational speeds. The investigation has been carried out at both ambient and cryogenic temperatures, the latter obtained through the application of liquid nitrogen at the drill site. Although there is an increase in drill thrust under cryogenic conditions enhancing the probability of delamination, this shortcoming is more than offset by the improved surface finish, hole quality and far superior tool life. Furthermore, delamination can be minimised by using a back support, a commonly followed practice in the industry. Interestingly, the poor surface quality and edge damage at the entry and particularly at the exit faces of the drilled holes can be minimised by the application of liquid nitrogen and are totally eliminated by the introduction of very thin resin-rich layers on the laminate surfaces. The delamination results are shown to agree reasonably well with the predictions made by a linear-elastic fracture mechanics model and are also investigated by using a three-dimensional, orthotropic, finite-element model. It is shown through finite-element analysis that any major surface delamination is unlikely to happen when a back support is used; however, crack propagation is still possible in the shearing mode.},

abstract = {Low-velocity impact damage can drastically reduce the residual strength of a composite structure even when the damage is barely visible. The ability to computationally predict the extent of damage and compression-after-impact (CAI) strength of a composite structure can potentially lead to the exploration of a larger design space without incurring significant time and cost penalties. A high-fidelity three-dimensional composite damage model, to predict both low-velocity impact damage and CAI strength of composite laminates, has been developed and implemented as a user material subroutine in the commercial finite element package, ABAQUS/Explicit. The intralaminar damage model component accounts for physically-based tensile and compressive failure mechanisms, of the fibres and matrix, when subjected to a three-dimensional stress state. Cohesive behaviour was employed to model the interlaminar failure between plies with a bi-linear traction-separation law for capturing damage onset and subsequent damage evolution. The virtual tests, set up in ABAQUS/Explicit, were executed in three steps, one to capture the impact damage, the second to stabilize the specimen by imposing new boundary conditions required for compression testing, and the third to predict the CAI strength. The observed intralaminar damage features, delamination damage area as well as residual strength are discussed. It is shown that the predicted results for impact damage and CAI strength correlated well with experimental testing without the need of model calibration which is often required with other damage models.},

The developed material model is implemented in a commercial explicit finite element (FE) software LS-DYNA through a user defined material subroutine (UMAT). The constitutive model is developed using data from uniaxial quasi-static and high strain rate tension tests, picture frame tests and friction tests. Different finite element modeling schemes using shell finite elements are used to study efficiency and accuracy issues. First, single FE layer (SL) and multiple FE layers (ML) were used to simulate the ballistic tests conducted at NASA Glenn Research Center (NASA-GRC). Second, in the multiple layer configuration, a new modeling approach called Spiral Modeling Scheme (SMS) was tried and compared to the existing Concentric Modeling Scheme (CMS). Regression analyses were used to fill missing experimental data - the shear properties of the fabric, damping coefficient and the parameters used in Cowper-Symonds (CS) model which account for strain rate effect on material properties, in order to achieve close match between FE simulations and experimental data. The difference in absorbed energy by the fabric after impact, displacement of fabric near point of impact, and extent of damage were used as metrics for evaluating the material model. In addition, the ballistic limits of the multi-layer fabrics for various configurations were also determined. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this study the perforation of composite sandwich structures subjected to high-velocity impact was analysed. Sandwich panels with carbon/epoxy skins and an aluminium honeycomb core were modelled by a three-dimensional finite element model implemented in ABAQUS/Explicit. The model was validated with experimental tests by comparing numerical and experimental residual velocity, ballistic limit, and contact time. By this model the influence of the components on the behaviour of the sandwich panel under impact load was evaluated; also, the contribution of the failure mechanisms to the energy-absorption of the projectile kinetic energy was determined. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Meslem2013,
abstract = {Electrodiffusion and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements were made in two impinging jets, the first exiting from a convergent nozzle and the second from a square-edged orifice nozzle having same exit diameter. The Reynolds number, based on nozzle diameter and exit bulk-velocity, was equal to 1360 in each flow. The wall-shear rate and mass transfer generated by orifice impinging jet on a flat plate are up to 42{\%} and 18{\%} respectively higher than in its counterpart convergent nozzle jet. The transfer feature on the impingement surface has a close relationship with near field flow dynamics, itself affected by flow conditions at the nozzle exit. The orifice jet flow generates larger in size, well-defined and vigorous primary Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) structures with comparison to the convergent nozzle jet. These differences were associated with differences in initial velocity profiles and in the resulting flow development. The vena contracta in the orifice jet generates a thinner shear layer and an increase of the exit mean velocity relative to exit bulk-velocity. Organized structures in the two flows are educed using DMD and POD applied to PIV measurements. The dominant frequency of each flow related to the K-H instability, captured using DMD analysis of PIV fields, is also obtained by studying energy spectra of electrodiffusion signals. A quantitative measure of the kinetic energy (KE) distribution in different POD modes reveals that for reconstruction of 80{\%} of the total KE, 7 modes are required for the orifice impinging jet and 42 modes for the convergent impinging jet. This comparison confirms the larger degree of flow organization in orifice jet before impinging on the target wall and explains its performance in the resulting mass transfer on the wall surface. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper, a new finite element formulation is presented for high-order impact analysis of sandwich beams with any boundary conditions subjected to simultaneous multiple small projectiles. The contact of the projectiles may occur on arbitrary places on both faces of the beam. Hamilton's principle is used for driving the governing partial differential equations of motion. The effect of each projectile is modeled by a one degree of freedom spring-mass system with variable stiffness by assuming the Hertzian contact law. The appropriate elemental matrices are derived for a sandwich beam element that carrying four sprung masses on both face sheets. Based on the presented formulation, an FE code is developed using the Newmark method with direct iteration process. The various cases are used to validate the predictions of the presented higher order theory and FE formulation shows good agreement with available results in the open literature and exact solution. Furthermore, numerical examples are presented to investigate effects of various parameters on the response of the structure. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The cylindrical aluminum foam projectile and steel projectile were used to exert the impulse on the laminates. Deformation/failure modes, deflections, strain histories, and failure mechanisms were obtained and discussed. The results showed that with the high toughness of Kevlar fiber, the deformation modes of the laminates exhibited some characteristics similar to the metal panel, such as large global deformation. The failure mechanisms like matrix failure, fiber splitting, and fibrillation were observed. These micron failures led to the macroscopic delamination and fracture of the laminates. },

In this study, the nonlinear finite element (FE) models of Weldox 700E and Kevlar 129/epoxy plates were created and validated against experimental data. A parametric study was conducted using numerical models to investigate the ballistic performance of monolithic steel plates, multi-layer steel plates, and hybrid plates made of steel and Kevlar layers, under impact conditions specified by the NATO Level I or EN1063 BR5 standards. In this parametric study, numerical simulations were performed on 30 different configurations of steel and hybrid plates subjected to impacts of.223 bullets at 900 m/s. The effects of layer thickness of monolithic and layer configuration of multilayer steel and hybrid plates were investigated in detail. The results showed that layer configuration could significantly affect the ballistic performance of layered steel and hybrid plates. A layered steel plate had superior ballistic protection to that of a corresponding monolithic steel plate. It was also found that the hybrid steel/Kevlar plate configurations resulted in a 26{\%} weight reduction compared to the monolithic steel plates while providing better ballistic protection.},

abstract = {Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRPs) composites are extensively used in structural applications due to their attractive properties. Although the components are usually made near net shape, machining processes are needed to achieve dimensional tolerance and assembly requirements. Drilling is a common operation required for further mechanical joining of the components. CFRPs are vulnerable to processing induced damage; mainly delamination, fiber pull-out, and thermal degradation, drilling induced defects being one of the main causes of component rejection during manufacturing processes. Despite the importance of analyzing thermal phenomena involved in the machining of composites, only few authors have focused their attention on this problem, most of them using an experimental approach. The temperature at the workpiece could affect surface quality of the component and its measurement during processing is difficult. The estimation of the amount of heat generated during drilling is important; however, numerical modeling of drilling processes involves a high computational cost. This paper presents a combined approach to thermal analysis of composite drilling, using both an analytical estimation of heat generated during drilling and numerical modeling for heat propagation. Promising results for indirect detection of risk of thermal damage, through the measurement of thrust force and cutting torque, are obtained.},

abstract = {Abstract In the present study, effect of hybridization on the hybrid composite armors under ballistic impact is investigated using hydrocode simulations. The hybrid composite armor is constructed using various combinations and stacking sequences of fiber reinforced composites having woven form of fibers specifically high specific-modulus/high specific-strength Kevlar fiber (KF), tough, high strain-to-failure fiber Glass fiber (GF) and high strength/high stiffness Carbon fiber (CF). Different combinations of composite armors studied are KF layer in GF laminate, GF layer in KF laminate, KF layer in CF laminate and CF layer in KF laminate at various positions of hybridized layers for a fixed thickness of the target. In this article the results obtained from the finite element model are validated for the case of KF layer in a GF laminate with experimental predictions reported in the literature in terms of energy absorption and residual velocity and good agreement is observed. Further, the effect of stacking sequence, projectile geometry and target thickness on the ballistic limit velocity, energy absorbed by the target and the residual velocity are presented for different combinations of hybrid composite armors. The simulations show that, at a fixed thickness of the hybrid composite armor, stacking sequence of hybridized layer shows significant effect on the ballistic performance. The results also indicate energy absorption and ballistic limit velocity are sensitive to projectile geometry. Specifically, it is found that arranging the KF layer at the rear side, GF layer in the exterior and CF layer on the front side offers good ballistic impact resistance. The hybrid composite armor consisting of a CF layer in KF laminate acquires maximum impact resistance and is the best choice for the design compared to that of other combinations studied.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA.

abstract = {This paper reports compression properties of three-dimensional carbon fiber/epoxy braided composites at temperatures from 23degC to 210degC under strain rate from 1200 s -1 to 2400 s -1. It was found that the elevated temperature has a negative effect on the compression properties, whereas the strain rate effect is positive. The compression modulus has a rapid degradation at the temperature of 120degC which is close to the glass transition temperature of epoxy resin obtained from the dynamic mechanical analysis. The results also showed that the shear deformation is the main failure mode of three-dimensional braided composites at high strain rates of compression load and high temperatures.},

abstract = {Modern military aircraft jet engines are designed with variable-geometry nozzles to provide optimal thrust in different operating conditions, depending on the flight envelope. However, acoustic measurements for such nozzles are scarce, due to the cost involved in making full-scale measurements and the lack of details about the exact geometries of these nozzles. Thus the present effort at Pennsylvania State University (PSU) in partnership with GE Aviation and the NASA Glenn Research Center is aiming to study and characterize the acoustic field produced by supersonic jets issuing from converging-diverging military style nozzles, and to identify and test promising noise reduction techniques. An equally important objective is to develop methodology for using data obtained from small- and moderate-scale experiments to reliably predict the full-scale engine noise. The experimental results presented show reasonable agreement between small-scale and medium-scale jets, as well as between heated jets and heat-simulated ones. {\textcopyright} 2014 Production and hosting by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of CSAA and BUAA.},

The study covered different size of meshing element on target plate as well as different level of impact velocities. Different failure modes for each case were found. For low speed impact condition a petalling was observed, whereas for high speed impact a radial neck along with a holes enlargement was observed with better and uniform perforation mode.

abstract = {Small scale explosive loading of sandwich panels with low relative density pyramidal lattice cores has been used to study the large scale bending and fracture response of a model sandwich panel system in which the core has little stretch resistance. The panels were made from a ductile stainless steel and the practical consequence of reducing the sandwich panel face sheet thickness to induce a recently predicted beneficial fluid-structure interaction (FSI) effect was investigated. The panel responses are compared to those of monolithic solid plates of equivalent areal density. The impulse imparted to the panels was varied from 1.5 to 7.6 kPa s by changing the standoff distance between the center of a spherical explosive charge and the front face of the panels. A decoupled finite element model has been used to computationally investigate the dynamic response of the panels. It predicts panel deformations well and is used to identify the deformation time sequence and the face sheet and core failure mechanisms. The study shows that efforts to use thin face sheets to exploit FSI benefits are constrained by dynamic fracture of the front face and that this failure mode is in part a consequence of the high strength of the inertially stabilized trusses. Even though the pyramidal lattice core offers little in-plane stretch resistance, and the FSI effect is negligible during loading by air, the sandwich panels are found to suffer slightly smaller back face deflections and transmit smaller vertical component forces to the supports compared to equivalent monolithic plates. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Compression and tension preloads that represent design limit load were considered as well as lower preloads that a structure would carry more frequently. Gas gun impact tests were performed to generate a validation database for comparison with results from numerical simulation. A modelling methodology to simulate preloads and transient impact events was documented. The numerical model captures intra- and inter-ply damage by using layers of shell elements connected with cohesive interface layers. Both test and simulation results indicate an influence of static preloads on the impact damage response. The numerical model was especially used to better understand the interaction between preloads and dynamic impact loads which are complex especially for impact on buckled plates.},

In this paper, four fillet radii at three nozzle length to diameter ratios are selected to study the flow dynamics of the radial pre-swirl rotor-stator system. The results obtained in this paper indicate that considering the effect of the ratio of fillet radius to nozzle diameter, rf/D, on the adiabatic effectiveness, the discharge coefficient of the receiver hole and the total pressure loss in the pre-swirl nozzle and the pre-swirl cavity, there is an optimum value of rf/D which can provide the best performance of the pre-swirl system. The effect of rf/D on the heat transfer coefficient h is also conducted. Numerical results clearly show that h on the rotor wall at low radius increases with rf/D. The uniform distribution of h on the rotor wall at receiver hole radius can be observed as synchronous rotation between the receiver hole and the cooling air occurs.},

abstract = {This paper presents the numerical simulations of thin-walled square hollow steel beams subjected to a uniform transverse blast load. The objectives of the numerical simulations were to gain an insight into the temporal distribution of the global and local deformation and the adiabatic temperature rise in the beams as a result of impulsive loading. Additionally, the finite element predictions using Ls-Dyna are compared to the experimentally observed global and local deformations. The full lengths of the beams were modelled using three material models based on the linear piecewise plasticity material model which incorporated strain hardening, with and without strain-rate hardening and with strain-rate hardening and temperature softening. The blast wave was simulated as a rectangular pressure pulse distributed over the top surface of the beams. Ls-Dyna and the material model used were found to predict the global and local deformation of the beams reasonably well. Incorporating strain-rate hardening was found to be important to be able to predict the global and local deformation of the beams. Thermal softening was found to play a small but not negligible role. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The influence of a cohesive zone model on the crack paths and the crack speed is studied. It will be shown that it has only a minor influence on the results for ductile fracture while it affects the crack speed for brittle fracture. Furthermore, the influence of temperature is tested, and it is shown that for ductile fracture, the temperature is the key parameter while it has less effect for brittle fracture. Double-notched and single-notched specimens are tested, and the experimental results are compared to results of our computational method for different discretisations. These results reveal that our method is a good pathway to study the failure transition from brittle-to-ductile fracture.},

A four-parameter hardening model is built to capture important features of the hardening curve and consequently gives the good matching of the experiments. Within the frame of plasticity theory, the detailed constitutive model, the numerical algorithm and the derivation of the tangent stiffness matrix are presented in this study to improve model robustness. This phenomenological model achieved excellent agreement between the experimental and simulation results in element scale respectively for glass fibre-reinforced polymer (GFRP) and carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP). Moreover, the model is capable of simulating the nonlinear phenomenon of laminates, and good agreement is achieved in nearly all cases.},

abstract = {An experimental study has been conducted to examine the effects of two different types of impact damage on the blast performance of sandwich composites. Sandwich composite specimens were subjected to impact by either a high velocity projectile or a low velocity drop weight. After impact, a secondary blast loading experiment was performed on the same specimens to evaluate the effects of the impact damage on the blast performance of the sandwich. Controlled blast loading was imparted using a shock tube apparatus while pressure data and high speed images of the dynamic event were captured. The experimental results showed impact damage from high velocity projectiles was most prominent on the exit face sheet of the sandwich specimens wherein damage to the core and impact face sheet, in the form of a hole, was minimal in comparison. Damage created by low velocity drop weights was concentrated on the impact face sheet and within the core adjacent to the impact face sheet. Low velocity impacts also generated de-bonding between the impact face sheet and core. Shear cracking in the core was the dominant effect of all blast loading. Although the specimens that had been struck by high velocity projectiles absorbed substantially more energy during impact experiments than those impacted by low velocity drop weights the damage created by low velocity impacts had the greatest detrimental effect on the blast performance of the sandwich composites. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This lightweight design concept enables sandwich structures to maximize their specific bending stiffness/strength and improve their energy absorption capability.

Low-velocity impact tests are conducted to study the impact resistance when impacted by conical, hemispherical and flat impactors. A user subroutine VUMAT is developed to model the CFRP face sheet behavior, in which a progressive damage model based on the Hashin failure criteria and Yeh delamination failure criteria is implemented in ABAQUS/Explicit. Reasonably good agreement is achieved when comparing impact force, absorbed energy, and failure modes between experimental measurements and numerical predictions. These studies reveal that damage, consisting of fiber damage, matrix damage and delamination of the face sheets as well as buckling of core members, depends on the impactor shape, impact energy and impact location. The investigations provide some insight into the failure mechanisms in this hybrid sandwich structure under low-velocity impact loading, which could be used in the development of novel lightweight multifunctional structures.},

abstract = {Recently, hypersonic research activities around the universe have been in major focus because of the milestone developments in hypersonic reentry vehicles, orbital transfer vehicles, reusable launch vehicles and space recovery experimental modules. One of the major problems in hypersonic flight is drag and with the tremendous progress in computational powers it can be analysed. In this work, the effects of counter flow jet on reduction of drag around two blunt cone flare bodies in the hypersonic turbulent flow arc investigated through a numerical study. Flow field around the blunt bodies is calculated numerically for the free stream Mach number of 6.5. Numerical solutions of Navicr-Stokes equation and energy equation governing the turbulent flow of compressible fluid are obtained by adopting Finite Volume Method (FVM) through an industry standard CFD code, FLUENT 6.3.26 package. Shear Stress Transport (SST) model was used in the computation of pressure drag, skin friction drag and total drag for both the absence of jet and the presence of jet cases for both the configuration . Contours of Mach number arc presented to describe the flow patterns. It is clear that the reduction of drag was greatly influenced by the jet conditions and body shapes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Explosive tests were performed in air to study the dynamic mechanical response of square honeycomb core sandwich panels made from a super-austenitic stainless steel alloy. Tests were conducted at three levels of impulse load on the sandwich panels and solid plates with the same areal density. Impulse was varied by changing the charge weight of the explosive at a constant standoff distance. At the lowest intensity load, significant front face bending and progressive cell wall buckling were observed at the center of the panel closest to the explosion source. Cell wall buckling and core densification increased as the impulse increased. An air blast simulation code was used to determine the blast loads at the front surfaces of the test panels, and these were used as inputs to finite element calculations of the dynamic response of the sandwich structure. Very good agreement was observed between the finite element model predictions of the sandwich panel front and back face displacements and the experimental observations. The model also captured many of the phenomenological details of the core deformation behavior. The honeycomb sandwich panels suffered significantly smaller back face deflections than solid plates of identical mass even though their design was far from optimal for such an application. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Predicting the damage tolerance of laminated composite aircraft components subjected to low velocity impact events, such as runway debris or hail, is providing a significant challenge to the current methods. This paper reviews the current damage mechanics and fracture methods for predicting delamination under impact available in the literature. Many damage mechanics models are available, some providing good delamination predictions. The linear elastic fracture mechanics method has been used extensively where the shape of the delamination front can be predicted and a suitably shaped mesh can be provided. However, as impact events produce irregular shaped delamination fronts, this method requires an adaptive mesh approach that is not yet available in any of the major analysis codes. The cohesive fracture model solves some of the limitation of the linear elastic fracture mechanics method, however a definitive study of its abilities has yet to be found in the literature. The delamination threshold load method is an extremely simple method and provides surprisingly good results. The review concludes that additional development of current techniques is required before a definitive predictive delamination method will be available. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, a dynamic plastic damage model for concrete material has been employed to estimate responses of both an ordinary reinforced concrete slab and a high strength steel fibre concrete slab subjected to blast loading. In the concrete material model, the strength envelope is a damage-based modified piece-wise Drucker-Prager model; the strain rate effect on tension and compression are considered separately; the damage variable is based on Mazars' damage model, which is a combination of tensile and compressive damage. The equation of state (EOS) is also a combination of the porous and solid EOS of concrete with different forms for tension and compression states. The interaction between the blast wave and the concrete slab is considered in the 3D simulation. In the first stage, the initial detonation and blast wave propagation is modelled in a 2D simulation before the blast wave reaches the concrete slab, then the results obtained from the 2D calculation are remapped to a 3D model. The calculated blast load is compared with that obtained from TM5-1300. The numerical results of the concrete slab response are compared with the explosive tests carried out in the Weapons System Division, Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Department of Defence, Australia. Repetitive applications of blast loading on slabs are also simulated and the results compared with test data. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Experimental investigations were carried out to determine the low velocity impact behavior of woven carbon fabric/polyphenylene sulfide (CF/PPS) laminates at room temperature (RT) and high-temperature (95 °C and 125 °C). The relationships of impact response and damage with temperature were established with the aid of macro- and micro-scopic observations and C-scan inspections. The analysis on impact behavior of CF/PPS composite at RT indicated that increasing incident impact energy led to increased low velocity impact-induced damage initiation and propagation. The results revealed that temperature increasing could lead to evident decrease of stiffness, energy based damage degree and delamination area, as well as evident increase of the permanent indentation. Take the specimens at 15 J and 125 °C as example, the permanent indentation and delamination were increased and decreased by 40.2{\%} and 57.45{\%}, respectively. The temperature influence on impact responses was closely associated with the plastic deformation of matrix and its coupling effect with the resin-rich regions and fiber-bridging mechanism that induced by the specific weave architecture. It has specified that the failure mechanism was transformed from brittle manner to ductile manner with increasing the temperature, which was characterized by the variation of intra- and inter-laminar cracks as well.},

abstract = {The influence of the fibre-polymer matrix interfacial bond strength on the explosive blast response of carbon fibre laminates is experimentally investigated. Air blast tests were performed on laminate target panels containing woven carbon fabric treated with a fibre-sizing agent that promoted either weak or strong bonding with the polymer matrix. The laminates were subjected to increasing shock wave impulse loads by increasing the mass or reducing the stand-off distance of the plastic explosive charge. High-speed digital image correlation photography (DIC) during explosive blast testing revealed the dynamic deformation responses and surface strains of the laminate targets were not influenced significantly by the type of fibre-sizing agent, except at high shock wave impulse levels. However, non-destructive testing using ultrasonics and X-ray computed tomography revealed that the initiation and growth of blast-induced damage (e.g. delamination cracks, matrix cracks, fibre fracture) was dependent to the interfacial bond strength. Damage occurred at a high shock impulse level in the laminate with strong fibre-matrix interfacial bonding, and this is attributed to higher flexural and interlaminar fracture toughness properties compared to the composite with weak interfacial bonding. The post-blast mechanical properties were also higher for the laminate with strong interfacial bonding. This study reveals that the fibre-sizing agent has a substantial influence on the explosive blast resistance and post-blast properties of laminates, and it is essential that an agent having high chemical compatibility with the polymer matrix is used to promote strong bonding.},

abstract = {The paper reports on an experimental and numerical investigation into the response of sandwich panels, with PVC foam cores and glass fibre reinforced vinyl ester face sheets, to localised blast loading. It also reports on the response of equivalent mass glass fibre reinforced vinyl ester panels. The loading was generated by detonating discs of plastic explosive at a small stand-off distance of 50 mm. Multiple failure modes were exhibited by the panels, including core compression, fragmentation and complete penetration, debonding between the face sheet and core, delamination between the fibre layers and rupture of the fibres. The sandwich panels exhibited complete penetration failure while no penetration occurred in the equivalent mass composite only panels. Reasonable agreement between the experimental results and numerical simulations is observed. The analysis reveals the reasons why the composite only panels perform better than the sandwich panels with PVC foam core. Due to the lower transverse stiffness of the individual components of the sandwich panel, considerably higher transverse velocity of the face sheet develops at the beginning of the process causing larger deflections and therefore larger in-plane stresses in the face sheet despite the high energy absorbing capacity of the foam core. The influence of the core density on the sandwich panel resistance to blast loading is also briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Luscher2018,
abstract = {Modeling and simulation of the dynamic response of materials is important to many applications including the development of armor systems, understanding the safety of explosives, and assessing the crashworthiness of vehicles. Within such applications it is often critical to accurately compute the evolution of the temperature because it is a state variable that affects the kinetics of competing active processes within the material (e.g., dislocation motion, phase transformation, decomposition). Depending on the selection of an independent state variable, e.g. temperature or entropy, the approach for computing temperature is well understood based on the thermodynamic framework attributed to Coleman and Noll. However, different computational codes used for modeling the dynamic response of materials adopt different independent state variables. In this work, two thermodynamically consistent strategies for computing the temperature of a coupled thermodynamic state are compared and implemented into two different Lagrangian computational codes. The equivalence of these two approaches is established through the numerical solutions of several test problems. Finally, the implication of various approximations made to each of these approaches within the literature are assessed in the context of uniaxial stress conditions (split Hopkinson pressure bar experiments) and uniaxial strain conditions (plate impact experiments). It is shown that the temperature rate or energy partition approaches are equivalent when implemented in their complete forms, but that several common simplifying assumptions, that are warranted in the case of uniaxial stress, lead to significant errors in the resulting Hugoniot state for plate impact.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a non-associated plane stress anisotropic constitutive model with mixed isotropic-kinematic hardening. The quadratic Hill 1948 and non-quadratic Yld-2000-2d yield criteria [Barlat F, et al. Int J Plasticity 2003;19: 1297-1319.] are considered in the non-associated flow rule (non-AFR) model to account for anisotropic behavior. To predict accurate hardening in cyclic loading conditions, a modification of the hardening model proposed by Chun et al. [Chun BK, et al., Int J Plasticity 2002; 18: 571-595.] is adopted. This one-surface non-linear mixed isotropic-kinematic hardening model does not require loading criterion and can predict Bauschinger effect, transient behavior and permanent softening. The developed model was implemented as a user-defined material subroutine (UMAT) into the commercial finite element code ABAQUS/Standard based on fully implicit backward Euler's method. Cup drawing simulation results for an automotive sheet metal AA5754-O show that the implemented hardening model avoids under- and over-estimation of the cup height respectively generated by kinematic and isotropic hardening laws. Moreover, as will be seen in the results of highly textured AA2090-T3, both cup height and earing profile generated by non-associated flow models are in better agreement with experimental results. Finally, the Yld2004-18p and non-AFR Yld2000-2d models are compared in terms of prediction of directional Lankford coefficients and yield stresses. It is shown that a same order of accuracy that is obtained by Yld2004-18p can be achieved by the non-AFR Yld2000-2d. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {CFRPs drilling is a common process in the aerospace industry carried out prior to components assembly. Machining induced damage leads to significant percentage of component rejection. Damage extension strongly depends on drilling geometry and cutting parameters. Fresh drill geometry changes with cutting time due to the wear progression and the risk for hole quality is enhanced as cutting progresses. The influence of wear on hole quality has been analyzed in the literature using mainly an experimental approach.Simulation of drilling process is an effective method that can be used to optimize drill geometry and process parameters in order to control hole quality and analyze the drill wear evolution. In this paper a finite element model for drilling woven CFRPs, reproducing both fresh and worn tools, is presented. Two different point angles considering fresh and honned edge were modeled. A progressive intra-laminar failure model based on the Chang and Chang model is considered. Cohesive elements allowed the analysis of inter-laminar damage (delamination). The model demonstrated its ability to predict thrust force and delamination for different values of feed rate and cutting speed. Model predictions show the influence of tool geometry (including variations induced due to wear) on delamination.},

abstract = {In the paper, a simple and efficient algorithm to track a moving delamination front of arbitrary shape, using a laminated finite plate element model in conjunction with the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT), is proposed. The solution requires the calculation of the virtually closed area in front of the delamination, which is approximated by means of a 6-node-polygon, the delamination opening behind this front and the reaction forces in the nodes at the delamination front. These quantities are calculated in a local coordinate system (LCS) defined in the nodes along the delamination front. Using the proposed algorithm, arbitrary meshes composed of 4- and 9-node quadrilateral finite elements can be considered. The proposed model is developed in the context of a layered finite element plate model. To prevent interlaminar penetration of adjacent layers in the delaminated region, an algorithm recently proposed by Marjanovi{\'{c}} et al. (2015) is adopted. The model performance is demonstrated by re-analyses of the Double-Cantilever-Beam problem, for which analytical solutions exist, and by transient analyses of laminated composite plates with propagating delamination fronts.},

@article{Puck2004,
abstract = {This chapter represents the author's contribution to Part B of the Failure Exercise. It explains graphs showing the theoretical predictions for failure envelopes and stress/strain diagrams of the 14 test cases. The successive failure of different laminates subjected to a variety of loading conditions is treated by a layer-by-layer failure analysis. Three sources of nonlinearity are considered-namely, material nonlinearity because of micro damage, matrix cracking, and changes in fiber angle with increasing strains. There is good agreement between predictions and experimental results. Some disagreement is because of imperfections in certain tests; therefore, these tests should be repeated. Three categories of laminate configuration/loading condition can be distinguished: (I) laminates with 3 or more fiber directions with arbitrary loading conditions; (II) balanced angle ply laminates with stress ratios in accordance with netting analysis; and (III) laminates with 2 fiber directions and loadings, which are not in accordance with netting analysis. The analysis of category (I) is straight forward. Category (II) is sensitive to the stiffness degradation after the onset of matrix cracking. Category (III) fails at low stresses and large strains of the laminate, because of a rapid deterioration. To define a failure limit for category (III), an intensive discussion is necessary. For the detection of the different modes (A, B, C) of inter-fiber fracture (IFF), refined action plane related IFF-criteria developed by Puck on the basis of Mohr's and Hashin's considerations on brittle fracture are explained.},

abstract = {A combined experimental and 3D dynamic nonlinear finite element (FE) approach was adopted to study damage in composite beams subject to ballistic impact using a high-speed gas gun. The time-histories of dynamic strains induced during impact were recorded using strain gages mounted on the front of the composite beam specimen. During ballistic impact tests, the impact velocity was also measured. The commercially available 3D dynamic nonlinear FE code, LS-DYNA, modified with a proposed user-defined nonlinear-orthotropic damage model, was then used to simulate the experimental results. In addition, LS-DYNA with the Chang-Chang linear-orthotropic damage model was also used for comparison. Good agreement between experimental and FE results was found from the comparisons of dynamic strain and damage patterns. Once the proposed nonlinear-orthotropic damage model was verified by experimental results, further FE simulations were conducted to predict the ballistic limit velocity (V50) using either the number of damaged layer approach or a numerically established relation between the projectile impact velocity versus residual velocity or energy similar to the classical Lambert-Jonas equation for metals. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Such a procedure establishes the similarity between the projectile's shape optimization in penetration dynamics and in aerodynamics of high speeds. The optimization of the impactor's nose shape can thus be reduced to the variational problem considered previously in connection with the projectile's shape optimization in high speed gas dynamics. Two example from the literature are analyzed when impactor's shape optimization involved difficulties whereas the mathematically similar problem was solved before in aeromechanics. Some aspects of applying gas dynamics similarity for optimization of the impactor's shape for bodies of revolution are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The influence of impact damage on the residual strength is described. A loss of 15{\%}-30{\%} in compression resistance was noticed for specimens impacted by 10 J.

The special study about the number of petals has been done for different nose angles using conical shape projectiles. The complete energy balance is also reported and the absorbed energy by the steel sheet has been obtained by measuring initial and residual projectile velocities. A wide range of impact velocities from 35 to 180 m/s has been covered during the tests. All the projectiles are 13 mm in diameter and the plates are 1 mm thick.

In this work, the von Karman theory for large deflections of plates was used to simulate the effect of large explosions on laminated glazing. Linear material properties were assumed for both the glass and Polyvinyl Butyral layers. The glass and PVB layers were assumed to act fully compositely during the pre-crack phase of the deformation. A higher order deflection function was employed to represent the complex deformed shape observed in DIC blast test data collected by Hooper et al. (2012). The deflection results showed that the method developed could produce accurate estimates of the glazing deformation history during a blast event. The analytical solution was also used to compute the reaction forces acting on the window supports, which were found to be of a similar magnitude to those calculated from experimental data. In addition, crack densities were predicted, which were found to follow a pattern similar to those seen in blast experiments. The analytical approach developed is valuable for risk assessment engineers and fa{\c{c}}ade designers who much prefer analytically based models over full-scale FE analysis, as FEA is often too time consuming for design assessments.},

abstract = {Fiber based composites have found extensive applications in various fields. In this study, two different fiber materials, namely, E-glass and carbon, with different architecture are chosen. Polymer (vinyl ester) based composites were designed using these fibers and were fabricated using VARTM process. These composites were subjected to quasi-static and high strain rates of loading utilizing different testing methodologies. In quasi-static testing, the tensile, compressive and shear properties were studied using existing ASTM standard testing procedures and the results are reported. The carbon composite showed higher tensile and compressive modulus. In-plane shear properties of both the composites were comparable and inter laminar shear properties of E-glass composites were observed to be better than the carbon composite because of the better nesting between the E-glass fabric layers. A shock tube and a controlled explosion tube were utilized in the study of dynamic damage behavior of these composite materials. Based on the experimental study, it is observed that the carbon fiber composites tend to achieve sudden destructive damage whereas E-glass fiber composites tend to sustain progressive damage, under dynamic loading. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Despite the increased applications of the composite materials in aerospace due to their exceptional physical and mechanical properties, the machining of composites remains a challenge. Fibre reinforced laminated composites are prone to different damages during machining process such as delamination, fibre pull-out, microcracks, thermal damages. Optimization of the drilling process parameters can reduces the probability of these damages. In the current research, a 3D finite element (FE) model is developed of the process of drilling in the carbon fibre reinforced composite (CFC). The FE model is used to investigate the effects of cutting speed and feed rate on thrust force, torque and delamination in the drilling of carbon fiber reinforced laminated composite. A mesoscale FE model taking into account of the different oriented plies and interfaces has been proposed to predict different damage modes in the plies and delamination. For validation purposes, experimental drilling tests have been performed and compared to the results of the finite element analysis. Using Matlab a digital image analysis code has been developed to assess the delamination factor produced in CFC as a result of drilling. ? Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

abstract = {A unit cell model is developed to capture the elasto-visco-plastic response of a long fibre composite using a 3-dimensional finite element model. Using a glass rubber model, the elasto-visco-plastic response of the matrix is analysed and the fibre is considered to deform elastically. A functionally graded interphase zone is defined in the region surrounding and encompassing a reinforcing fibre. The model subdivides the interphase zone into an infinite number of concentric rings where stress and strain compatibility is preserved. This model aims to improve on the computational efficiency of micromechanics models where the fibre and matrix are modeled as separate materials. The mechanics of the fibre deformation are governed by a transformation tensor for transversely isotropic materials based on Eshelby's method. The model is calibrated using experimental data for the transverse compression of a unidirectional composite; it is then validated using axial compression and shear data for quasi static strain rates. For moderate strain rate the model is also calibrated for one of the transverse strain rates then validated using the other strain rates and axial compression. The proposed unit cell model is capable of predicting the elasto-visco-plastic response of long fibre composites to a very high accuracy.},

abstract = {The present study is based on the experimental and numerical investigations of deformation behavior of layered aluminum plates of different thicknesses under the impact of flat, ogive and hemispherical nosed steel projectiles. Thin-layered plates arranged in various combinations were normally impacted at different velocities with the help of a pneumatic gun. Ballistic limit velocity and the residual velocity of the projectiles for each layered combination were obtained experimentally as well as from the finite element code, and these were compared with those of the single plates of equivalent thicknesses. For two layers, the residual velocity was comparable to that of the single plate, however, when the number of layers was increased the velocity drop was found to be higher in the case of the single plate. Ogive nosed projectile was found to be the most efficient penetrator of the layered target. Hemispherical nosed projectile required maximum energy for perforation. Deformation profiles of the target plates in the layered combinations were measured, and it was found that hemispherical nosed projectile caused highest plastic deformation of target plates. Numerical simulation of the problem was carried out using finite element code ABAQUS. Explicit solution technique of the code was used to analyze the perforation phenomenon. Results of the finite element analysis were compared with experiments and a good agreement between the two was found. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

Critical conditions for the occurrences of the instability and the reverse of the projectile trajectory are discussed. It was found that the relative location of mass centre of the projectile has strong influence on the control of the rotation of the projectile, and thus, the projectile stability and the change of trajectory direction.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria A new category of structural metals with high strength and good ductility is coarse-grained metals strengthened by nanotwinned (NT) regions. This unique combination makes them particularly suitable for applications in bulletproof targets. The extent of this improvement, however, depends on the volume fraction of the NT regions and multiple other microstructural features. Here, a numerical model based on the strain gradient plasticity and the Johnson–Cook failure criterion is developed to study the effects of these attributes. The ballistic performance is quantified by two indices: the limit velocity that measures its ability to resist failure and the limit displacement that measures its ability to resist deformation. The results obtained indicate that, in general, a relatively small twin spacing and a moderate volume fraction of NT regions can achieve both excellent limit velocity and limit displacement. Moreover, array-arranged NT regions are more effective than staggered NT regions in enhancing the limit velocity, but the influence of the array group tends to depend more on the volume fraction of NT regions than the latter one. Mechanism analyses based on the three stages of the impact process and two categories of low-speed impact are performed. The simulated results could provide significant insights into the NT structures for a superior class of nanotwin-strengthened metals for ballistic protection.},

abstract = {The mechanical response and fracture of metal sandwich panels subjected to multiple impulsive pressure loads (shocks) were investigated for panels with honeycomb and folded plate core constructions. The structural performance of panels with specific core configurations under multiple impulsive pressure loads is quantified by the maximum transverse deflection of the face sheets and the core crushing strain at mid-span of the panels. A limited set of simulations was carried out to find the optimum core density of a square honeycomb core sandwich panels under two shocks. The panels with a relative core density of 4{\%}-5{\%} are shown to have minimum face sheet deflection for the loading conditions considered here. This was consistent with the findings related to the sandwich panel response subjected to a single intense shock. Comparison of these results showed that optimized sandwich panels outperform solid plates under shock loading. An empirical method for prediction of the deflection and fracture of sandwich panels under two consecutive shocks-based on finding an effective peak over-pressure-was provided. Moreover, a limited number of simulations related to response and fracture of sandwich panels under multiple shocks with different material properties were performed to highlight the role of metal strength and ductility. In this set of simulations, square honeycomb sandwich panels made of four steels representing a relatively wide range of strength, strain hardening and ductility values were studied. For panels clamped at their edge, the observed failure mechanisms are core failure, top face failure and tearing at or close to the clamped edge. Failure diagrams for sandwich panels were constructed which reveal the fracture and failure mechanisms under various shock intensities for panels subjected to up to three consecutive shocks. The results complement previous studies on the behavior and fracture of these panels under high intensity dynamic loading and further highlights the potential of these panels for development of threat-resistant structural systems. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study presents both experimental testing and phenomenological mesomodeling for composite laminates under high-velocity impact. First, we conducted high-velocity impact tests on CFRP laminates and investigated the penetration and damage behaviors. Three kinds of internal damage were observed: fiber breakage, matrix cracking, and delamination. The observed matrix cracks were classified into two categories: multiple (diffuse) cracks around the impact point and large (dominant) cracks on the bottom ply. A phenomenological mesomodel was then developed based on these experiment observations. In the presented model, both continuous and discrete damage models were implemented for modeling two crack configurations. For comparison, we presented two conventional models (one using only the discrete damage model, and the other using only the continuous damage model). To validate the presented model, high-velocity impact simulations were performed, and the predicted results were compared with experiment and conventional models in terms of the damage area and distribution.},

abstract = {Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite sandwich panels with hybrid foam filled CFRP pyramidal lattice cores have been assembled from a carbon fiber braided net, 3D woven face sheets and various polymeric foams, and infused with an epoxy resin using a vacuum assisted resin transfer process. Sandwich panels with a fixed CFRP truss mass have been fabricated using a variety of closed cell polymer and syntactic foams, resulting in core densities ranging from 44-482kgm-3. The through thickness and in-plane shear modulus and strength of the cores increased with increasing foam density. The use of low compressive strength foams within the core was found to result in a significant reduction in the compressive strength contributed by the CFRP trusses. X-ray tomography led to the discovery that the trusses develop an elliptical cross-section shape during pressure assisted resin transfer. The ellipticity of the truss cross-sections increased, and the lattice contribution to the core strength decreased as the foam density was reduced. Micromechanical modeling was used to investigate the relationships between the mechanical properties and volume fractions of the core materials and truss topology of the hybrid core. The specific strength and moduli of the hybrid cores lay between those of the CFRP lattices and foams used to fabricate them. However, their volumetric and gravimetric energy absorptions significantly exceeded those of the materials from which they were fabricated. They compare favorably with other lightweight energy absorbing materials and structures. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

The elastic dynamic equations of this profiled rod flying at high velocity after detonation are set up on the basis of Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the aeroelastic deformation of profiled rod is calculated by semi-analytical method for calculating the vibration characteristics of variable cross-section beam. In addition, the aeroelastic deformation of the undeformed profiled rod and the aeroelastic deformation of deformed profiled rod which is caused by the detonation of explosive are simulated by computational fluid dynamic and finite element method (CFD/FEM), respectively. A satisfactory agreement of these two methods is obtained by the comparison of two methods.

The mechanics-based understanding of the fluid-structure interaction occurring during the impact, was devoted to understand the role of water-backing on the loading experienced by the panel, toward informing the interpretation of empirical observations and design of new experiments. Non destructive and destructive evaluations for damage investigations were carried out whereas the design and the production of a new, more simple and reliable Compression After Impact (CAI) apparatus, was described and adopted to avoid errors due to misalignment between the applied load and the specimen. CAI tests were then, performed to evaluate the residual compression strength. Analytical and semi empirical models were evaluated and validated to predict the influence of the geometric parameters on the impact behaviour of the laminates. The final aim was to predict the impact energy, delamination and residual strength, in the different test conditions.},

These targets formed part of two studies presented here: one, to observe the loading of the same geometry of target to an increasing shock intensity; and the second, to observe the response of one target to multiple blast impacts. Experimental data provides detailed data for sandwich panel response, which are often used in civil and military structures, where air-blast loading represents a serious threat. High-speed photography, with digital image correlation (DIC), and laser gauge systems were employed to monitor the deformation of these structures during the blasts. The experimental data provides for the development of analytical and computational models. Initial analysis of the blast experiments are presented alongside a finite element model to establish trends in deformation behaviour. Details of failure mechanisms and the conditions for the onset of failure are also discussed.},

abstract = {Wing-in-Ground effect aircraft is one that manages level flight near the surface of the Earth, making use of the aerodynamic interaction between the wings and the surface known as take advantage ground effect. Ground effect is a phenomenon that relates to the airflow around a wing when it flies in close proximity to a surface, wherein the presence of the surface distorts the downwash from the wing and inhibits the formation of vortices. This effect dramatically increases the lift and reduces the drag compared to that attainable by a wing in conventional flight. The WIG crafts can transport heavy payloads at relatively high speeds, compared to ships. Since the 1960's, There have been many experiments on Wing in Ground Effect crafts and the Ekranoplan. While some believe that it will bring a new era of high speed marine transportation, others believe it holds less promise than the hovercraft. This paper presents a Wing-In-Ground effect craft design as an alternative to the current ships, a means of faster and safer transportation over water. An initial design is presented for a rigid airship that has the capacity for 16,000 lbs of payload and 2 crew members with 497 miles of range. iv},

It was verified that the temperature has negligible influence for higher impact energies, while a strong effect occurs for lower energies.

abstract = {This article presents the current status of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods as applied to the simulation of turbulent jet flowfields issuing from aircraft engine exhaust nozzles. For many years, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) methods have been used routinely to calculate such flows, including very complex nozzle configurations. RANS methods replace all turbulent fluid dynamic effects with a turbulence model. Such turbulence models have limitations for jets with significant three-dimensionality, compressibility, and high temperature streams. In contrast to the RANS approach, direct numerical simulation (DNS) methods calculate the entire turbulent energy spectrum by resolving all turbulent motion down to the Kolmogorov scale. Although this avoids the limitations associated with turbulence modeling, DNS methods will remain computationally impractical in the foreseeable future for all but the simplest configurations. Large-Eddy simulation (LES) methods, which directly calculate the large-scale turbulent structures and reserve modeling only for the smallest scales, have been pursued in recent years and may offer the best prospects for improving the fidelity of turbulent jet flow simulations. A related approach is the group of hybrid RANS/LES methods, where RANS is used to model the small-scale turbulence in wall boundary layers and LES is utilized in regions dominated by the large-scale jet mixing. The advantages, limitations, and applicability of each approach are discussed and recommendations for further research are presented. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A cohesive zone model implemented in an augmented Lagrangian functional is used for simulation of meso-scale fracture problems in this paper. The method originally developed by Lorentz is first presented in a rigorous variational framework. The equivalence between the stationary point of the one-field problem and the saddle point of the mixed formulation is proved by solving the double inequality of the mixed functional. An adaptation to simulate fracture phenomena in the meso-scale via mesh modification is also presented as an algorithm to insert zero-thickness interface elements based on Lagrange multipliers, boarding the non-trivial task of the field interpolation for different crack paths (plain and tortuous). A suitable tool to study the matrix fracture and debonding phenomena in composites with strongly different component stiffnesses that avoids ill-conditioning matrices associated with intrinsic cohesive zone models is obtained. The method stability is discussed using a simple patch test. Some numerical applications to fracture problems taking into account the mesostructure and, particularly, the study of transverse failure of longitudinal fiber reinforced epoxy and the fracture in concrete specimens are included in the paper. Comparing the numerical results with the experimental results obtained by other researchers, the paper introduces a discussion about the influence of coarse aggregate volume in meso-scale fracture mechanisms in concrete L-shaped specimens.},

abstract = {In this paper a new numerical procedure by Gusev, for predicting the elastic and thermoelastic properties of short fibre reinforced composites, is described. Computer models, comprising 100 non-overlapping aligned spherocylinders, were generated using a Monte Carlo procedure to produce a random morphology. Periodic boundary conditions were used for all the generated structures. Where necessary, the generated microstructures were based on measurements of real materials: for example a measured fibre length distribution was used to seed the Monte Carlo generator to produce a computer model with an equivalent fibre length distribution (FLD). The generated morphologies were meshed using an intelligent 3 dimensional meshing technique, allowing the elastic and thermo-elastic properties of the microstructures to be calculated. The numerical predictions were compared with those from three commonly used micromechanical models, namely those attributed to Halpin/Tsai, Tandon/Weng and Cox (shear lag). Firstly, the effect of volume fraction and aspect ratio were investigated, and the numerical results were compared and contrasted with those of the chosen models. Secondly, the numerical approach was used to investigate what effect a distribution of fibre lengths, as seen in real materials, would have on the predicted mechanical properties. The results were compared with simulations carried out using a monodispersed fibre length, to ascertain if the distribution of lengths could be replaced with a single length, and whether this length corresponded to a particular characteristic of the distribution, for example the first moment or average length. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The laminate is comprised of layers of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and polycarbonate (PC) bonded by an adhesive, and its deformations are analyzed by the finite element method. The mathematical and computational models of the system have been described in our previous work, and their predictions compared with test data (Composite Structures, 116, 193-210, 2014). The thermo-elasto-viscoplastic materials of the PMMA and the PC and the viscoelastic material of the adhesive involve a large number of material parameters whose precise values are unknown. Here we consider values of eleven material parameters - five for the PMMA, five for the PC and one for the adhesive. It is found that values of Young's moduli and Poisson's ratios of the PMMA and the PC, and the shear modulus of the adhesive strongly influence the plate deflection and the crack length. Values of material parameters of the PC that noticeably affect its plastic deformations also determine the energy dissipation whose correlation with the second peak in the contact force between the impactor and the laminate is exhibited. The PMMA layer thickness is found to influence the crack length and the PC layer thickness the energy dissipated.},

abstract = {The low-velocity impact response of a range of fiber metal laminate (FML) panels was investigated through testing and finite element simulations. The objective of this study was to understand the impact-damage resistance of these novel composites, so that they can be designed optimally for impact-resistant aircraft applications. The FML panels were made up of aluminum alloy 7475 T761 and unidirectional S2 glass/epoxy oriented in a cross-ply configuration. Experimental tests were performed using a free-fall drop dart testing machine. The plate specimens were constrained on a circular edge by the clamping fixture. The shape and the nature of the damage inflicted by impact were evaluated using both destructive cross-sectional microphotography and nondestructive ultrasonic techniques. The tests showed that FML laminates are capable of absorbing energy through localized plastic deformation and through failure at the interface between the layers. In particular, delaminations occurred in the back face of the aluminum-alloy sheet and its adjacent fiber-reinforced epoxy layer and in between adjacent fiber-reinforced epoxy layer. The finite element code, LS-DYNA3D, was used to perform numerical simulations of low-velocity impact to predict the complex damage propagations. The computed post-impact deformed shapes and damage patterns were found to be fairly close to experimental results.},

abstract = {A method for modeling the initiation and growth of discrete delaminations in shell-like composite structures is presented. The laminate is divided into two or more sublaminates, with each sublaminate modeled with four-noded quadrilateral shell elements. A special, eight-noded hex constraint element connects opposing sublaminate shell elements. It supplies the nodal forces and moments needed to make the two opposing shell elements act as a single shell element until a prescribed failure criterion is satisfied. Once the failure criterion is attained, the connection is broken, creating or growing a discrete delamination. This approach has been implemented in a three-dimensional finite element code. This code uses explicit time integration, and can analyze shell-like structures subjected to large deformations and complex contact conditions. The shell elements can use existing composite material models that include in-plane laminate failure modes. This analysis capability was developed to perform crashworthiness studies of composite structures, and is useful whenever there is a need to estimate peak loads, energy absorption, or the final shape of a highly deformed composite structure. This paper describes the eight-noded hex constraint element used to model the initiation and growth of a delamination, and discusses associated implementation issues. Particular attention is focused on the delamination growth criterion, and it is verified that calculated results do not depend on element size. In addition, results for double cantilever beam and end notched flexure specimens are presented and compared to measured data to assess the ability of the present approach to model a growing delamination.},

Impact induced delamination and matrix cracking have been used as failure criteria for the optimization of laminate. Fiber orientation, material and thickness in each lamina as well as number of lamina in the laminate have been used as design variables.

The results obtained from the integrated module show that GA with FEM can lead to a near optimal solution for both single as well multiple objective functions. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study proposes a constitutive model of viscous behaviour of short-fibre reinforced composites (SFRC) with complex distributions of fibre orientations and for a wide range of strain rates. The model is based on an additive decomposition of the state potential for the computation of composite macroscopic behaviour. Thus, the composite material is seen as the assembly of a matrix medium and several linear elastic fibre media. The division of short fibres into several families means that complex distributions of orientation or random orientation can be easily modelled. The matrix behaviour is strain-rate sensitive, i.e. viscoelastic and/or viscoplastic. Viscoelastic constitutive laws are based on a generalised linear Maxwell model and the modelling of the viscoplasticity is based on an overstress approach. The accuracy of the model is assessed for the case of polypropylene reinforced with short glass fibres. Matrix material parameters are identified from experimental tests carried out at several loading rates. Distributions of fibre orientation are characterised by micro-computed tomography. Comparisons between numerical and experimental responses in different loading directions and under different strain rates demonstrate the efficiency of the model.},

Diagrams are presented to show the history of relevant kinematical, dynamic and energetic quantities, both to synthesize the dependency of the energy parameters and force threshold values on the impact velocity.

Load-unload tests are performed to identify the sequence and extent of damage and the corresponding displacements at which they occur for a wide range of laminate thicknesses. Energies absorbed at different levels of damage are obtained from the load-unload curves. Two different support spans of 25.4 mm (1 in.) and 101.6 mm (4 in.) diameter with different layers (1, 2, 4, 6, 11, and 22 with 0.6 mm ply thickness) of composite laminates are tested under quasi-static loading to identify compression-shear and tension-shear dominated modes of damage. After each test, the damaged plates are sectioned to visualize the extent of delamination and material damage. Numerical punch-shear experiments are conducted using LS-DYNA 970. The numerical modeling is carried out using a newly developed composite damage model, namely MAT 162, which has been incorporated into LS-DYNA. MAT 162 uses damage mechanics principle for progressive damage and material degradation. Input data required in MAT 162 have been calibrated to match the experimental results of 22-layer composite plate of both spans (25.4 and 101.6 mm). The calibrated material properties have been used to simulate other thicknesses, and the simulated results show good agreement with experiment results. It has been found that the dominant damage mechanisms are delamination and fiber breakage due to shear and tension. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper develops a 3D homogenization-based continuum damage mechanics (HCDM) model for fiber reinforced composites undergoing micro-mechanical damage. Micromechanical damage in the representative volume element (RVE) is explicitly incorporated in the form of fiber–matrix interfacial debonding. The model uses the evolving principal damage coordinate system as its reference in order to represent the anisotropic coefficients. This is necessary for retaining accuracy with nonproportional loading. The material constitutive law involves a fourth order orthotropic tensor with stiffness characterized as macroscopic internal variable. Damage in 3D composites is accounted for through functional forms of the fourth order damage tensor in terms of macroscopic strain components. The HCDM model parameters are calibrated by using homogenized micromechanical (HMM) solutions for the RVE for a few strain histories. The proposed model is validated by comparing the CDM results with HMM response of single and multiple fiber RVEs subjected to arbitrary loading history. Finally the HCDM model is incorporated in a macroscopic finite element code to conduct damage analysis in a structure. The effect of different microstructures on the macroscopic damage progression is examined through this study.},

abstract = {Strong, low density fibres have been favoured materials for ballistic protection, but the choice of fibres is limited for making body armour that is both protective and lightweight. In addition to developments of improved fibres, alternative approaches are required for creating more protective and lighter body armour. This paper reports on a study on hybrid fabric panels for ballistic protection. The Finite Element (FE) method was used to predict the response of different layers of fabric in a twelve-layer fabric model upon impact. It was found that the front layers of fabric are more likely to be broken in shear, and the rear layers of fabric tend to fail in tension. This suggested that using shear resistant materials for the front layer and tensile resistant materials for the rear layer may improve the ballistic performance of fabric panels. Two types of structure, ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) woven and unidirectional (UD) materials, were analyzed for their failure mode and response upon ballistic impact by using both FE and experimental methods. It was found that woven structures exhibit better shear resistance and UD structures gives better tensile resistance and wider transverse deflection upon ballistic impact. Two types of hybrid ballistic panels were designed from the fabrics. The experimental results showed that placing woven fabrics close to the impact face and UD material as the rear layers led to better ballistic performance than the panel constructed in the reverse sequence. It has also been found that the optimum ratio of woven to UD materials in the hybrid ballistic panel was 1:3. The improvement in ballistic protection of the hybrid fabric panels allows less material to be used, leading to lighter weight body armour. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

Delamination (or inter-laminar cracking) was modelled using interface cohesive elements while splitting and transverse matrix cracks (intralaminar cracking) that appeared within individual plies were also simulated by inserting cohesive elements along the fibre direction (at a crack spacing determined from experiments for computing efficiency). A good agreement is obtained when the numerically predicted results are compared to both experimentally obtained curves of impact force and absorbed energy versus time and X-ray radiography damage images, provided the interface element stiffness is carefully selected. This gives confidence to selected fracture criteria and assists to identify material fracture parameters that influence damage resistance of modern composite material systems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Blast tests using plastic explosive charges were performed in air on square target plates made of carbon-polyester, glass-polyester, carbon-vinyl ester or glass-vinyl ester laminates, which are composite materials used in naval ships. The laminates were dynamically loaded by shock waves of increasing pressure and impulse, and the deformation, damage and residual mechanical properties were determined. The amount of blast-induced damage and the post-blast mechanical properties depend on both the fibre reinforcement and polymer matrix. E-glass laminates have higher resistance to blast-induced delamination cracking and tow rupture than carbon fibre composites. Furthermore, glass or carbon fibre laminates with a vinyl ester matrix have superior blast damage resistance compared to composites with a polyester matrix. The higher damage resistance is attributed to the higher flexural strain energy capacity and interlaminar fracture toughness properties of laminates containing glass fibres or vinyl ester matrix.},

abstract = {A number of mechanisms have been proposed for the penetration of laminates comprising ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibres in a polymeric matrix. Two-dimensional ballistic experiments are conducted in order to directly observe the transient deformation and failure processes occurring immediately under the projectile via high-speed photography. Two sets of experiments were conducted on [0°/90°]nlaminate beams. First, back-supported and free-standing beams were impacted by cuboidal projectiles of varying mass and fixed geometry. The observations indicate that in both cases, failure occurs in a progressive manner, with plies first failing immediately under the impact zone. The dynamic failure mode is qualitatively similar to that in a quasi-static indentation tests, and attributed to tensile ply failure by the generation of indirect tension within the plies. Direct membrane stretching is ruled out as failure that occurred with negligible beam deflection. In the second set of experiments, the projectile mass was kept constant and its width varied. No dependence of the projectile width was observed in either quasi-static indentation or dynamic penetration tests. This strongly suggests that failure is not governed by a shear process at the edge of the projectile. The observations presented here therefore suggest that tensile ply failure by indirect tension rather than membrane stretching or shear failure at the edges of the projectile is the dominant penetration mechanism in UHMWPE laminates.},

abstract = {Composite materials are finding use in an increasing number of structural applications as a result of their high specific strength, high specific stiffness, thermal resistance and the potential for tailoring of properties to suit specific applications. Fibre-reinforced composites, foam core sandwich panels and fibre-metal laminates (FMLs) are examples of composite materials that are employed in high-performance engineering applications, for example in yachts, passenger aircraft, racing cars and sports equipment. Explosive loading is a potential threat to many of these structures, and therefore an improved understanding of the response of such systems to air-blast loading is important. This paper reviews recent experimental and numerical work on the response of composite materials, sandwich structures and hybrid materials to air-blast loading. Commonly employed experimental techniques used to simulate air-blast loading conditions are described, along with the results from recent experiments on plain composite laminates, polymeric sandwich panels and FMLs. The influence of loading distribution, materials and test geometry on the failure of composites is discussed. The latter part of paper discusses numerical modelling considerations and reports methods and results from recent numerical modelling work on the blast loading of composites},

abstract = {The effects of high temperature exposure on the low velocity impact behaviors and damage mechanisms of all-composite pyramidal truss core sandwich panels were investigated by experiment in this paper. The composite sandwich panels were manufactured from unidirectional carbon/epoxy prepreg and exposed to different temperatures for 6. h. The impact tests of exposed specimens were performed at three different energy levels, and the effects of exposure temperature and impact energy level on the damage mechanism, absorbed energy and maximum impact force were analyzed. The impact-damaged specimens were subsequently subjected to in-plane compressive tests in order to investigate the effect of exposure temperature and impact energy level on the compressive failure load. The results have shown that the high temperature exposure has a significant effect on impact properties and damage mechanisms of specimens. The fiber fracture, node failure, delamination and buckling were observed during low velocity impact tests and the extent of damage area was significantly affected by exposure temperature. In addition, the absorbed energy increased with increasing exposure temperature, while the maximum impact force and compressive failure load after impact decreased with increasing exposure temperature due to the degradation of the matrix properties and fiber-matrix interface properties at higher temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The inelastic response of thin aluminium and steel plates subjected to airblast loading is studied numerically and validated against experimental data. Special focus is placed on the influence of elastic effects and negative phase on the structural response. The blast loading was varied by detonating spherical charges of plastic explosives at various stand-off distances relative to the centre point of the plates. The numerical results obtained with the finite element code EUROPLEXUS were in good agreement with the experiments and predicted the entire range of structural response from complete tearing at the supports to a more counter-intuitive behaviour (CIB) where the final configuration of the plate was in the opposite direction to the incident blast wave due to reversed snap buckling (RSB). RSB attracted special attention since this is an unstable configuration sensitive to small changes in the loading and in structural characteristics. The negative phase of the blast pressure is usually neglected in blast-resistant design. However, the numerical simulations showed that the negative overpressure dominated the structural response and led to RSB at some loading and structural conditions. Two distinctive types of CIB were identified and both were found to depend on the timing and magnitude of the peak negative overpressure relative to the dynamic response of the plates. The study also revealed that CIB may occur in thin plates when the negative impulse is of the same order of magnitude as the positive impulse. The partial and complete failure along the boundaries observed in some of the tests was also successfully recreated in the simulations by using an energy-based failure criterion and element erosion.},

abstract = {This paper describes the damage development in ceramics with and without composite cover during ballistic impact. This is relevant for ceramic inserts in body armor that are often covered with a composite material. To study the effect of the cover on the damage development in the ceramic, projectile impact experiments were performed at sub-muzzle velocities on bare alumina tiles and plates covered with a fiberglass composite. In addition to the experiments, finite element simulations were performed. An atypical formulation was used; Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) for the projectile and Lagrangian for the ceramic target. For the ceramic target, an unconventional material model was chosen; the pseudo-geological model 72{\_}R3 in LS-DYNA. Cracking damage in the recovered plates was characterized in a manner that clearly distinguished between cracking mechanisms and allowed the cracks to be tracked and quantified. In light of the common use of composite cover for ceramics in body armor, an unexpected result was found; that the covered plates showed significantly more damage than the bare plates. The simulations successfully matched details of the cracking patterns and elucidated the damage evolution in the ceramic plates. The simulation results explained the damage observations as the result of restraining effects, i.e. the restraining effect of the composite cover keeps the damaged ceramic in the path of the projectile resulting in increased damage.},

The main objective of the paper focuses on the relationship between damage of the material and the effective elastic properties for the purpose of stress analysis of structures. A homogenized continuum is adopted for the constitutive theory of anisotropic damage and elasticity. Internal variables are introduced to describe the evolution of the damage state under loading and as a subsequence the degradation of the material stiffness. The corresponding rate-equations are subjected to the laws of thermomechanics. Emphasis is placed on a suitable coupling among the equations for the rates of the damage variables with respect to different damage modes. Evolution equations for the progression of the passive damage variables complete the kinetic equations. Most material parameters are obtained from uniaxial and simple shear tests as demonstrated by the example. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

For modeling the back-up woven-fabric material and deformation of yarns during perforation, the kinetic and strain energy of yarns has been determined. In the stress-strain relation of yarns, the effect of the strain rate is considered. Furthermore, a failure model based on the energy absorbed until failure by woven fabric is also used. Residual velocity, velocity-time history of projectile, residual mass of fragmented ceramic conoid, penetration depth until failure of yarns and energy absorbed by woven fabric are all estimated by new analytical model. Velocity-time history of the projectile shows a good agreement with the Chocron-Galvez numerical model.

Two simple, passive devices are examined to explore alternate methods for stall control and lift-to-drag improvement. The motivation behind this research is to study effective techniques to improve performance with fewer drawbacks than previously existing methods. An evaluation scheme is presented to compute airfoil lift, drag and pitching moment for a range of angles-of-attack up to stall. NACA 64{\textless}inf{\textgreater}1{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}-212 single-element and slatted airfoil CFD results are compared with experimental data to validate the computational model. Evaluations on the first conceptual design (Stall vane) show elimination of the separation at 15 degrees of angle-of-attack where the flow reversal normally starts at 86{\%} - chord. A total drag increase of 22{\%} is detected because of the sharp leading-edge of the device, but the main element drag has a reduction of 43{\%}. The maximum lift coefficient does not show a significant change on the same model. The second device (Dimples) demonstrates the potential of lift-to-drag ratio improvement at the higher angle-of-attack.

abstract = {The ultimate objective of this study is to provide further understanding of the behaviour of laminated composites of varying lamina orientations and stacking sequences, when under high-velocity impact. Emphasis is placed on the determination of ballistic limits of these composites. To this end, an experimental program is carried out and a computational model, with progressive damage modeling capabilities, is developed using LS-DYNA. Experiments are performed whereby striking velocities are measured, via high-speed photography, to determine the ballistic limits of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates of various stacking sequences. The results are reproduced closely by a numerical simulation, indicating that the numerical analysis conducted, including the choice of material model and contact definition, is an accurate means for modeling the high-speed impact characteristics of CFRP laminates. It is found that the use of static elastic and strength properties to describe the material is reasonable, since strain rate effects are found to be negligible. The kinetic energy of the projectile, plotted over the simulated impact duration, is used as the prime parameter to compare the experimental and numerical results. The numerical results accurately predict the experimental ballistic limit for six of the seven tested laminate stacking sequences. Failure due to delamination is found to play a vital role with respect to the energy absorbing ability and lamina stacking sequence of CFRP laminates. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Composite materials of various types and forms have become important engineering solutions for the construction of a range of mechanical, aerospace and marine structures. The use of laminated composite materials in fabricating these structures has resulted in a significant increase in payload, weight reduction, speed, fire resistance, maneuverability and durability. This paper addresses the numerical simulation of ballistic impact of composite laminated plates, using finite element method (FEM). The aim of this work is to determine the ballistic limit velocity when changing the lay-up of the laminated plate. These changes can be virtually done by numerical simulation using FEM. Two different models utilising E glass fibre/reinforced epoxy are developed to validate the numerical results at low and high impact velocities. After validating numerical results, different materials such as kevlar and carbon composites are utilised in order to investigate the ballistic impact analysis of the composite laminate. T...},

Glass-reinforced vinyl ester composites stitched in the through-thickness direction with thin Kevlar{\textregistered}-49 yarn were impacted with a bullet travelling at 0.9 km s-1or an underwater explosive shock wave moving at 1.5 km s-1. The amount of delamination damage to the composite caused by a ballistic projectile was reduced slightly with stitching. Stitching was highly effective in increasing the damage resistance against explosive blast loading. The increased damage resistance was due to the stitching raising the Mode I interlaminar fracture toughness of the composite. While the stitched composites experienced slightly less damage, their flexural modulus and strength was similar to the properties of the unstitched composite after ballistic impact testing. The post-blast flexural properties of the stitched composites, on the other hand, were degraded less than the properties of the unstitched material. {\textcopyright} 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The main goal is to analyze how the projectile shape may change the ballistic properties of materials. A wide range of impact velocities from 35 to 180 m/s has been covered during the tests. All the projectiles were 13 mm in diameter and the targets were 1 mm thick, as such the projectile can be regarded as rigid and the target sheets were of interstitial-free (IF) steel. The mass ratio (projectile mass/steel sheet mass) and the ratio between the span of the steel sheet and the diameter of the projectile were kept constant, equal to 0.38 and 3.85 respectively. To define the thermoviscoplastic behavior of the target material, the Rusinek-Klepaczko (RK) constitutive model [1] was used. The complete identification of the material constants was done based on a rigorous material characterization. Numerical simulations of some experimental tests were carried out using a non-linear finite element code ABAQUS/Explicit. It was found that the numerical models are able to describe the physical mechanisms in the perforation process with a good accuracy.},

abstract = {This paper addresses a micromechanics based strength theory to estimate the ultimate strength of unidirectionally fiber reinforced composites. The fibers used can be transversely isotropic in an elastic region but become isotropically hardening in a plastic one. The matrix material is considered as isotropically elastic-plastic. The stress state generated in each constituent material is explicitly expressed as a function of overall applied loads by making use of a bridging matrix that correlates the stress state in the fibers with that in the matrix. In this way, the composite strength is treated in terms of those of the constituent materials. Whenever one of the constituent materials attains its failure stress state, the corresponding overall applied stress is defined as the ultimate strength of the composite. This is because in most cases either the fiber fracture or the matrix breaking is the source that initiates the composite failure. The well-developed maximum normal stress theory of isotropic materials is applied to govern the constituent failure. One of the best advantages of the present theory is that the composite strength can be well estimated using minimum number of input data, which are the constituent properties and the fiber volume fraction only. Another advantage is that the failure mode, and the stress level in each constituent material are automatically indicated when the composite fails. Such information is important for composite design. The present theory has been used to predict the off-axial strengths or strength envelop of a number of unidirectional composites. Good correlation between the predicted strengths and available experimental data has been found. Application to laminate strength analysis has been shown. The simulated strength envelope of an angle-plied laminate using original constituent properties agrees well with experimental data. Comparison of this strength theory with another well-known phenomenological theory, the Tsai-Wu theory, shows that the present theory is grossly much more accurate for the considered laminate, which indicates that understanding of the matrix inelastic deformation is critical for laminate strength analysis. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Thought disorder has been described as a hallmark feature in both adult and childhood-onset schizophrenia. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been repeatedly proposed as a critical station for modulating gating of information flow and processing of information within the thalamocortical circuitry. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship of thought disorder measures, which were administered to 12 children with schizophrenia and 15 healthy age-matched controls, and NAc volumes obtained from high-resolution volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analyses. The propensity for specific thought disorder features was significantly related to NAc volumes, despite no statistically significant differences in the NAc volumes of children with schizophrenia and normal children. Smaller left NAc volumes were significantly related to poor on-line revision of linguistic errors in word choice, syntax and reference. On the other hand, underuse of on-line repair of errors in planning and organizing thinking was significantly associated with decreased right NAc volumes. The results of this pilot study suggest that the NAc is implicated in specific thought patterns of childhood. They also suggest that subcortical function in the NAc might reflect hemispheric specialization patterns with left lateralization for revision of linguistic errors and right lateralization for repair strategies involved in the organization of thinking.},

In this article, we argue that deterministic blast-loading methods do not fully account for society's usual acceptance (or rejection) of the risks associated with damage, safety and/or injury as a result of an explosive blast-load. This article details the state of the art of probabilistic blast-load modelling that supports a quantitative calculation of risk, with respect to damage, safety and injury. The probabilistic models draw data from the literature and from our own field trials.

Previous applications of the theory in this context continued to be linked with eigenstrain, equivalent inclusion, and back stress concepts, and many times involved energy considerations. In this paper we adopt the 'direct approach' of defining and computing effective moduli. By elucidating the nature of the approximation in applying Mori-Tanaka's theory to composites insofar as the 'concentration-factor' tensors are concerned, we achieve a straightforward exposition and interpretation of the method which are different than those existing in previous formulations. The analysis is given for two-phase composites with anisotropic elastic constituents and an inclusion phase consisting of aligned or randomly oriented ellipsoidal particles. The derived simple expressions for the predicted stiffness and compliance tensors permit a proof of the self-consistency of the method, a discussion of the predictions' relation to the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds in the case of isotropic constituents and randomly oriented ellipsoidal particles, and finally a derivation of some new results in randomly cracked bodies with penny-shaped cracks. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {The controlled energy input into the system by introducing an extra heat source to enhance the material flow along with reduction of the plunging force remains a potential area of considerate for the development of hybrid friction stir welding (FSW) process. Hence, the effect of preheating on the weld joint properties is evaluated using plasma-assisted friction stir welding (P-FSW) process for joining aluminum alloy. A comparative study of mechanical and macro-microstructural characterizations of weld joint by FSW and P-FSW has been performed. Transverse tensile strength of weld joint is approximately 95{\%} of base metal produced by P-FSW and is 8{\%} more than conventional FSW welds. The effect of preheating enhances material flow and dissolution of fine oxide particles by plasma arc results in increase of strength and marginal modification of deformation behavior. The preheating brings uniformly distributed hardness in weld zone and the magnitude is higher in the advancing side with overall increase in average hardness value. Grain sizes are much finer due to the pinning effect of Al{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}particles that retarded grain growth following recrystallization during P-FSW and thus led to more pronounced reduction in grain size and relatively brittle fracture during tensile loading of welded joint. Overall, the influence of preheating acts quite homogeneously throughout the structure as compared to conventional FSW. However, the results reveal that the development of P-FSW is still in initial stage and needs to improve in various aspects. {\textcopyright} 2014, ASM International.},

abstract = {The determination of the energy balance in explosive welding is an important scientific task because information on the itemized expenditure of the energy given off during an explosion makes it possible to manage energy release items and, consequently, to effectively control the structure and properties of the composite materials produced. In the general case, the energy liberated during an explosion is used for the interaction of welded plates: it is spent on the acceleration of the flyer plate and is also wasted on the dispersion of explosion products. A calorimetric method was used to determine the portion of the energy transferred to the flyer plate by detonation products. It was determined that the amount of energy does not exceed 1{\%} of the total energy of the explosion. It was also shown that during the collision of explosively welded plates, a portion of the kinetic energy of the flyer plate transforms into other types of energy and is also released as heat; this energy was measured using the calorimetric method. The heat is given off in the weld joint area as a result of the shock wave action, which crushes the microrelief of the welded surfaces, plastically deforms the metal in the collision area (shear and wave formation) and leads to dissipative losses throughout the metal body of the welded plates. A method is proposed to determine energy losses occurring in the system of colliding plates. This method is based on laminated models and makes it possible to determine a quantitative relation between energy losses on the jet, on the one hand, and the kinematic parameters of explosive welding, on the other. The contribution of explosive welding parameters to the amount of energy spent on the plastic deformation of metal in the collision zone is analysed. The results obtained make it possible to evaluate the explosive welding efficiency required for explosive welding: the efficiency is determined by the specific energy of an explosive converted to the energy spent on the plastic deformation of metal in the weld joint zone. It is shown that the efficiency varies from 0.5 to 3{\%}, depending on the welding regime.},

The main aim of this research is the evaluation of stresses in the hands of a cricket batsman. Very less literature has been found to attempt such an analysis, although it can be of great use, like predicting the location of injury, predicting the performance of the safety wear being used by the batsman, etc. One of the aims of this work is also to study in detail the variation in the ball exit velocity with respect to the impact location on the blade. Finite Element Modeling is used as an approach to predict the exit velocity of the ball. Three situations with various velocities of bat and ball are considered and simulated. The results confirm the existence of sweet spot, and indicate the same location where minimum amplitude of vibration is expected. A study on the reaction forces on the hand due to both the bat swing as well as ball impact is done. It is seen that reaction forces are minimum for sweet spot impact. The load on the hand is observed to be a dynamic load, occurring for a period almost five times the impact period of ball. A study is also performed on the stress distribution in the hand of the batsman, due to these reaction forces.

abstract = {This paper addresses an application of a versatile yet user-friendly micromechanics model, the bridging model, to simulate the mechanical properties of composites reinforced with woven and braided fabrics. The application is elaborated with a 2-D 1 x 1 woven and braided fabric geometry. The elastic, elasto-plastic, and ultimate strength behavior of the fabric composites under any arbitrary load condition can be easily characterized by using this model. The most important feature of the model is that the stress states generated in the constituent fiber and matrix materials are explicity correlated with the overall applied load on the composite. Thus, the complete behavior of the composite can be treated in terms of that of the constituent materials, which are well understood in the literature. A composite failure is attained whenever either the fiber or the matrix fails. A geometric model combining elliptical cross-section and sinusoidal undulation is proposed to describe the fabric geometry, with or without inter-yarn gaps. Only subdivision in the fabric plane is carried out, and the stresses in all three components (warp yarn, fill yarn, and pure matrix) of each sub-element are obtained through laminate analysis. The overall stresses in the fiber and matrix of the composite are assembled on the basis of an iso-stress assumption. Several 2-D 1 x 1 woven- and braided-fabric composites have been analyzed. The predicted stiffness and strength are in good agreement with available experimental data. Parametric studies have also been performed to investigate the effect of inter-yarn gap sizes on the stiffness and strength of woven- and braided-fabric composites, which show useful information for composite design.

abstract = {Some of the important mechanisms for defeating various projectiles and shaped charge are reviewed in this paper. These mechanisms are based on the compressive strength of the target material (its inherent resistance to penetration) and on the asymmetrical forces which it exerts on the threat, through proper geometrical arrangements. We discuss the basic features of the resistance to penetration, starting with the classical analysis of the cavity expansion process in elasto-plastic solids. This property of the target is responsible for the deceleration of hard cored projectiles and for the erosion of long rods, under normal impact conditions. We then discuss the asymmetrical interaction of armor piercing (AP) projectiles, long rods and shaped charge jets with inclined plates (stationary and moving). These asymmetric forces, exerted on the impacting threat, are responsible for their deflection and breakup. Our work combines experimental observations with numerical simulations and engineering models, which highlight the basic mechanisms behind these complex situations. This understanding is necessary for optimizing the performance of any armor design against a given threat. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The material model is implemented into a user-defined material (VUMAT) subroutine for the commercial finite element code ABAQUS/Explicit to predict the numerical response of circular aluminum plate subjected to low velocity impact. The impact energy was imposed by the definition of the impactor initial velocity.

Numerical simulations using FEM are carried out to study the influence of welding-induced residual stresses and deformation on the impact strength of plate panels. Welding is simulated using a three dimensional thermal mechanical coupled finite element method. The welding stress and deformation are taken as the initial imperfections in the impact strength analysis and their influence on the behavior of plate panels subjected to impact loadings. The impact loadings from the three directions, the lateral direction and two in-plane directions of the plate panels are studied. Results show a certain reduction in the impact strength due to the existence of welding stress and deformation in the plate panels. It is found that the reduction of impact force is strongly influenced by the welding deformation and the impact directions in the plate panels. This reduction is more significant when the impact force is in the lateral direction.},

abstract = {Displacement and stress fields in a functionally graded (FG) fiber-reinforced rotating disk of nonuniform thickness subjected to angular deceleration are obtained. The disk has a central hole, which is assumed to be mounted on a rotating shaft. Unidirectional fibers are considered to be circumferentially distributed within the disk with a variable volume fraction along the radius. The governing equations for displacement and stress fields are derived and solved using finite difference method. The results show that for disks with fiber rich at the outer radius, the displacement field is lower in radial direction but higher in circumferential direction compared to the disk with the fiber rich at the inner radius. The circumferential stress value at the outer radius is substantially higher for disk with fiber rich at the outer radius compared to the disk with the fiber rich at the inner radius. It is also observed a considerable amount of compressive stress developed in the radial direction in a region close to the outer radius. These compressive stresses may prevent any crack growth in the circumferential direction of such disks. For disks with fiber rich at the inner radius, the presence of fibers results in minimal changes in the displacement and stress fields when compared to a homogenous disk made from the matrix material. In addition, we concluded that disk deceleration has no effect on the radial and hoop stresses. However, deceleration will affect the shear stress. Tsai-Wu failure criterion is evaluated for decelerating disks. For disks with fiber rich at the inner radius, the failure is initiated between inner and outer radii. However, for disks with fiber rich at the outer radius, the failure location depends on the fiber distribution. {\textcopyright} 2017 by ASME.},

The results show that the stress-strain curves and the compression properties are significantly different in the longitudinal, in-plane and transverse direction. Meanwhile, the compression properties at liquid nitrogen temperature are improved significantly than that at room temperature. Moreover, the damage and failure patterns of composites vary with the loading directions and test temperature. At liquid nitrogen temperature, the brittle failure feature becomes more obvious and the interfacial adhesion capacity is enhanced significantly. In addition, the compressive properties and failure mechanism at room and liquid nitrogen temperature can be significantly affected by the braiding angle and the fiber volume fraction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Two different thicknesses of the 3DFGF and four different configurations of FMLs are considered. In particular, the stiffness, strength, energy absorption and failure modes of these configurations of FMLs against impact are compared. To make the comparison unbiased, the impact capacities of FMLs are normalized with respect to their weight and cost, which are the two significant parameters that govern the selection of design of mechanical systems. In addition to the experiments, a finite-element model is constructed using the commercial finite-element code ABAQUS/Explicit, in conjunction with its VUMAT facility, to analyze the impact response of the FMLs. Good agreements between the experimental and computational results are obtained, demonstrating that the model can be used to predict the response of such FMLs and further optimize the configuration and response of such sophisticated systems.},

Experimental tests were performed considering circular simple supported plates impacted on its centre. The analyses of the results issuing from load-time, load-displacement and energy-time curves have shown that the sole impact of 3 J is more detrimental for the plate, relative to the other cases of cumulative damage (1 J + 2 J and 1 J + 1 J + 1 J). A fine-tune analysis of damage evolution between subsequent impacts using a numerical procedure including a cohesive mixed-mode damage model was also performed. This analysis permits to verify the evolution of the projected delaminated area as well as the fracture process zone in the vicinity of delaminations. It was verified that a negligible evolution of damage occurs in the case of three consecutive impacts of the same energy. Additionally, it was concluded that the cumulative damage in the case of (1 J + 2 J) is inferior to the one propitiated by the sole impact of maximum energy (3 J). {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods/Analysis :  BFRP and GFRP composites with unidirectional cloth and Owen fabric are fabricated by compression moulding machine and their mechanical properties were determined by using UTM as per ASTM standards . Vibration analysis of these materials was carried out by using modal analysis set up for various end conditions . Natural frequencies and damping coefficients were determined by for all materials and end conditions . These results were compared with numerical results which are carried by using ABACUS software . Findings :  Fundamental natural frequency of glass/epoxy composites is better than the basalt/epoxy composites . The natural frequency changes with end condition and fiber orientations . Due to high stiffness ,  the natural frequency of Basalt Owen fabric composites is higher than that of unidirectional basalt/epoxy composites . Damping coefficient of unidirectional Basalt laminate at cantilever condition is good ( 0837 ) but the same value for Owen fabric with CNT is 0.00818 . Increment in damping coefficient is due to compression moulding process . Due to high pressure the fiber volume fraction increases and correspondingly the stiffness also increases .

However, ceramics is inherently brittle and there is a considerable problem to predict the strength and overall behaviour of the material subjected to high-velocity impact. In this article, we consider new modification of Discrete Element Method implemented in LS-DYNA code to simulate 6.35 steel ball impact on alumina ceramics. Discrete rigid spheres in this method linked together through truss-like bonds that allows to simulate linear-elastic solid material behaviour. After breaking of bonds, particles continue to interact with each other and with any structure by using standard DEM algorithm. Model calibrations based on the data obtained from biaxial strength tests and material elastic constants were performed. Calculated residual velocities were in a good agreement with experimental ones. With a minor additional calibration, the approach will allow to obtain realistic fragmentation of ceramic target and can be a useful tool for analysis of brittle solid behaviour during static and dynamic loading.},

abstract = {In this paper, the ballistic resistance of double-layered steel shields against projectile impact at the sub-ordnance velocity is evaluated using finite element simulations. Four types of projectiles of different weight and nose shapes are considered, while armor shields consist of two layers of different materials. In a previous study of the same authors, it was shown that a double-layered shield of the same metal was able to improve the ballistic limit by 7.0-25.0{\%} under impact by a flat-nose projectile, compared to a monolithic plate of the same weight. Under impact by a conical-nose projectile, a double-layered shield is almost as capable as a monolithic plate. The present paper extends the analysis to double-layered shields with various metallic material combinations. The study reveals that the best configuration is the upper layer of high ductility and low strength material and the lower layer of low ductility and high strength material. This configuration results in some 25{\%} gain in the ballistic limit under moderate detrimental impact. This research helps clarify the long standing issue of the ballistic resistance of the multi-layered armor configuration. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTWe evaluated two numerical modelling methods based on different modelling scales in simulating the ballistic performance of composite laminates. An orthogonal continuous material model was developed and used to establish an equivalent macro-scale impact model of a projectile/composite target (uniform model). Combining the Chang–Chang failure model and tiebreak contact algorithm, the corresponding computational model for the cross-plied microstructure of composite laminates was constructed layer by layer (layered model). Using the two modelling methods mentioned earlier, a series of ballistic impact simulations were carried out for Kevlar/epoxy composite laminates, and the simulation results were compared with the corresponding experimental results. The computational capacities of the two methods were compared in terms of damage pattern, ballistic limit, residual velocity and computational efficiency. The results indicate that the uniform model can simulate the main ballistic impact behaviour of co...},

For the sandwich composite composed of core and facesheet thicknesses of 0.95 cm and 0.25 mm respectively. The ballistic limit was determined to be 96 m s-1, indicating that it was capable of withstanding impacts from small projectiles such as, secondary debris from blast, hurricane, tornado and foreign object debris from roads and runways. The visual inspection and non-destructive evaluation (NDE) tests showed that the damage was relatively localized. A neat perforation was observed on the strike side facesheet whereas the back facesheet indicated greater spread of damage. The effect of prior damage in terms of residual and absorbed energies became more pronounced as the number of impacts increased. Damage areas were measured in order to quantify the extent of visible failure and/or perforations, while NDE tap testing was implemented to extract the information regarding interfacial damage. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {When laminated composite materials in modern aircraft structures are subject to impact loads, they are typically not unloaded but under a certain state of prestress. Therefore, in this study the effect of a compressive preload on the low velocity impact behaviour of three different carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) materials is investigated. An experimental test programme is documented first, including the design of a preload test device, the specimen manufacture and the results description. An increased deflection and energy absorption for composite plates with a preload of 80{\%} of the buckling load could be observed. Non-destructive inspections showed a large extent of delaminations occurring between individual plies, being an important energy absorption mechanism. The development of numerical simulation methods for this impact scenario using the commercial explicit finite element code LS-DYNA is described in detail. The focus is on the composite material, delamination and preload modelling. The final simulation results showed a good correlation to the experimental data in terms of force and energy plots or the evaluated interlaminar and intralaminar damage, although these numerical results proved to be strongly influenced by simulation parameters like mesh size or the number of shell element layers. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Both the designers and users of body armor face interesting choices - how best to balance the competing requirements posed by weight, thickness and cost of the armor package for a particular threat level.

In this research we use the explicit finite element analysis and explain how the models are built and the results verified. The Johnson-Holmquist material model in LS-DYNA is used to model the impact phenomenon in ceramic material. A user defined material model is developed to characterize the ductile backing made of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) material. An ad hoc design optimization is carried out to design a thin, light and cost-effective armor package.

The stiffness of the springs changes as the damage region grows with time. The proposed model predictions of the force between impactor and laminate and size of the damaged region are compared with the finite element (FE) simulation results and available experimental results in the literature for CFRP laminates.

abstract = {In this paper, high velocity impact responses of newly designed sandwich panels with aluminium (AL) foam core and metal fibre laminate (FML) skins, which are comprised of aluminium sheets and plain woven E glass fibre composite plies are investigated. Gas gun impact tests were conducted to investigate the high velocity impact response of the panels subjected to the impact from a steel ball bearing at an impact velocity of around 210 m/s. The effect of the thickness of the foam core and FML skin on the impact resistance of the panels is also investigated via experimental study. A finite element model is developed for effective numerical modelling of the impact behaviour of the sandwich panels using the commercially finite element software ANSYS LS-DYNA for more extensive study of the impact response of the sandwich panels. The simplified Johnson Cook material model, the composite damage material model based on the Chang-Chang criteria, and the crushable foam material model are used to model the aluminium sheets, composite plies and the AL foam respectively. Three types of contact algorithms, i.e. the erosion contact type, the tie-break contact type and the general 3D contact type are employed to define the various contacts during the impact and to model the delamination between the FML layers and debonding between the FML skin and the AL foam. The finite element model is validated by comparing the simulated impact behaviour to that from experimental for a sandwich panel subjected to high speed impact and demonstrated to be effective and accurate. The effect of the shape of projectile and impact angle on the impact behaviour of the sandwich panels is studied using the developed finite element model.

abstract = {The study of the structural blastworthiness is aimed to design efficient structures to protect the personnel inside the armor vehicle. Designing blastworthy structures requires not only high strength material, but also the capability of the structure to absorb the blast impact energy. The use of the sandwich construction with martensitic steel as the armor material and metallic foam as the energy absorber is promising to obtain the lightweight blast impact resistant structure. Recent development in military vehicle application has shown that the high strength material alone is not sufficient to protect the military personnel. This is due the fact that many injury and fatality of the military personnel still occurred even though the military vehicle still intact in the event of the blast impact event. Therefore, it is needed to design structures which have the capability to protect the vehicle subjected to the blast impact loading and to reduce the injury and fatality risk of the military personnel. The present blastworthy structural model with sandwich metal-foam plate construction is examined using non-linear finite element. The structural responses in terms of the displacement, velocity and acceleration is studied. Blast impact load is modeled using blast load equation by defining the charge and standoff distance. The sandwich structure is modeled as the shell and solid elements, using the Johnson-Cook and Crushable Foam material constitutive models. Parametric studies were carried out by varying panel thickness, specific material and foam density for certain blast load and impact stand-off distance. The objective of the parametric study is to analyze the dynamic responses of the sandwich structure with respect to the displacement, velocity, absorbed energy, and acceleration. The result obtained indicate that the metal-foam sandwich construction can be developed as the blastworthy component with high structural efficiency. The efficiency of metal foam to protect against blast load is shown by the absorbed energy respons.},

abstract = {In the present work, an analytical model is proposed to obtain the damage area of the composite laminates at below ballistic limit velocities. The model is based on the fact that total kinetic energy of the projectile is absorbed by different energy absorbing mechanisms taking place in laminates during impact. Depending upon the projectile velocity, some or all energy absorbing mechanisms observed are; fibre breakage, deformation of fibres, delamination, matrix cracking and cone formation on the back face of the laminates. The accuracy of the model is then assessed by comparing its predictions for damage area and specific energy absorption with the experimental values for two different types of fibres (glass and kevlar) as well as glass/kevlar hybrid combinations. Experimental results are also used to quantify and compare the specific energy absorption capacity of the glass/epoxy, kevlar/epoxy and glass/kevlar/epoxy laminates. It is observed that the glass/kevlar/epoxy laminates in which kevlar percentage is 27.5{\%} w/w showed 20{\%} improvement in specific energy absorption as compared to the glass/epoxy laminates. {\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor {\&} Francis Group.},

abstract = {In this study, the effect of fiber content on the flexural property of continuous carbon fiber/epoxy composites was investigated. Samples with four different fiber volume fractions, 50, 60, 70, and 80 vol.{\%}, were fabricated. For comparisons, cast epoxy resin was also prepared. It was observed that the flexural strength and modulus of this material are enhanced with increasing fiber volume fractions in the range of 50–70 vol.{\%}. Results show that the carbon fiber/epoxy composites possess the largest fracture force and displacement when the fiber volume fraction is 70 vol.{\%}, which is mainly attributed to the effective stress transfer of fibers. This can restrict crack tip propagation and blunt the crack tip, then consume abundant deformation energy and result in an increase of fracture work. On the other hand, poor flexural property was observed when the sample with high fiber volume fraction (80 vol.{\%}) was tested. Three different types of failure modes were observed according to the fiber content.},

abstract = {This chapter describes a micromechanical prediction procedure to simulate the progressive failure strength of a composite laminate subjected to multiaxial loading. Essentially, two steps are observed in the simulation of a multidirectional laminate. The chapter explains the first step in which a laminate analysis is performed using the classical lamination theory. The purpose of the laminate analysis is to obtain the in-plane strain and curvature increments of the laminate and further to determine the stresses sheared by each lamina in the laminate. The most important quantity involved in this step analysis is the instantaneous stiffness matrix of the lamina, which will be used to construct the laminate overall stiffness matrix. A recently developed micromechanics model, the bridging model, is used to define this instantaneous stiffness matrix and to relate the stress increments in the constituent fiber and resin materials of the lamina with those stress increments exerted on it. The thermal residual stresses generated in the constituents because of mismatch between the coefficients of thermal expansion in the fiber and resin materials are addressed and have been incorporated in the analysis. As long as one of the constituents attains its ultimate stress state, the lamina is considered to have failed and its contribution to the overall stiffness matrix of the laminate is reduced. The chapter presents a total reduction strategy. In this way, the progressive failure process in the laminate can be understood and the corresponding failure mode can be identified automatically. A generalized maximum normal stress criterion is adopted to detect the constituent failure. The prediction procedure has been applied to 14 different composite laminates, where failure envelopes or stress-strain curves up to final failure subjected to biaxial loading are required. The predicted results are reported in figures and data tables.},

abstract = {The single-stage gas gun testing methodology was investigated. A thermodynamics based method was used to estimate the required pressures for a targeted velocity. The transmitted impact force was measured with four load cells installed behind the testing frame. The out-of-plane deformation was measured with a projection grating profilometry method using a high speed camera. The velocity of the projectile was determined from the high speed video footage. The improved gas gun experiment was used to investigate the high velocity impact behavior of a S2-glass/SC15 epoxy composite. The ballistic limit was found to be 338 m/s and 406 m/s for the 6-ply and 10-ply composite panels, respectively. It was observed that the failure modes of the composite panels evolved with the impact velocity. The area of damage and failure first increased and then became localized. The panels absorbed the same or even a slightly higher amount of energy beyond the ballistic limit before damage localization. The ballistic protection capability of the S2-glass composite was compared with other materials in terms of EBL, a new parameter proposed in this work. EBLis the energy absorbed by the target at the ballistic limit normalized by the contact area.},

abstract = {To date, no specific framework has been developed to guide composite structure designers to select the optimum fiber types and fabric weave patterns for a given application. This article aims to, first, investigate the effect of weighting methods in multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) and then arrive at a systematic framework for optimum weave pattern selection in fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Namely, via measured data from an industrial case study, the TOPSIS MCDM technique has been applied to choose the best candidate among different polypropylene/glass laminates. As an input to TOPSIS, different types of subjective and objective weighting methods were initially compared to assess the role of relative importance values (weights) of design criteria. These included the Entropy method, the modified digital logic (MDL) method, and the criteria importance through inter-criteria correlation (CRITIC) method. Next, two new subjective weighting methods, named 'Numeric Logic (NL)' and 'Adjustable Mean Bars (AMB)' methods, were introduced to give more practical and effective means to the decision makers during the weighting of criteria. In particular, compared to the MDL, the NL method increased the accuracy of assigned weights for an expert DM. On the other hand, the AMB provided a more interactive, visual approach through MCDM weighting process for less experienced DMs. Finally, a generalized combinative weighting framework is presented to show how different types of weightings may be combined to find more reliable rankings of alternatives. The combinative weighting could specifically accommodate different scenarios where a group of designers are involved and have different levels of experience, while given a large number of alternatives/criteria in highly nonlinear applications such as impact design of composite materials.},

Tests were undertaken on sandwich structures based on plain composite and fibre-metal laminate (FML) skins. Impact testing was conducted using a 10 mm diameter projectile at energies up to that required to achieve complete perforation of the target. High velocity impact tests on the sandwich structures resulted in a number of different failure modes. Delamination and longitudinal splitting of the composite skins were observed in the unidirectional glass fibre/polypropylene-based systems. In contrast, the woven glass fibre/polypropylene-based sandwich structures exhibited smaller amounts of delamination after high velocity impact testing. In addition, the aluminium foam in both systems exhibited a localised indentation failure followed by progressive collapse at higher impact energies. The ballistic limit of all of the sandwich structures was predicted using a simple analytical model. It has been shown that the predictions of the model are in good agreement with the experimental data. Finally, it has been shown that these novel systems offer excellent energy absorbing characteristics under high velocity impact loading conditions. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Blast profiles and two primary methods of determining them were reviewed for use in the creation of a computer program for calculating blast pressures which serves as a design tool to aid engineers or analysts in the study of structures subjected to explosive air blast. These methods were integrated into a computer program, BLAST.F, to generate air blast pressure profiles by one of these two differing methods. These two methods were compared after the creation of the program and can conservatively model the effects of spherical air blast and hemispherical surface burst. The code, BLAST.F, was used in conjunction with a commercial finite element code (NASTRAN) in a demonstration of method on a 30 by 30 inch aluminum 2519 quarter plate of fixed boundary conditions in hemispherical ground burst and showed good convergence with 256 elements for deflection and good agreement in equivalent stresses of a point near the blast between the 256 and 1024 element examples. Application of blasts to a hypothetical wing comprised of aluminum 7075-T6 was also conducted showing good versatility of method for using this program with other finite element models.},

abstract = {The use of carbon/epoxy composites in aircraft, marine, and automotive structural applications is steadily increasing. Robust composite structures processed using low-cost techniques with the purpose of sustaining high velocity impact loads from various threats are of great interest. An example of a low-cost process is the out-of-autoclave, vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) technique. The present study evaluates the perforation and damage evolution created by various projectile geometries in VARTM processed carbon/epoxy laminates. A series of ballistic impact tests have been performed on satin weave carbon/epoxy laminates of 3.2 and 6.5 mm thickness, with projectile geometries representing hemispherical, conical, fragment simulating and flat tip. A gas-gun with a sabot stripper mechanism was employed to impact the samples with 50-caliber projectiles of the different shapes. The perforation mechanism, ballistic limit, and damage evolution of each laminate has been studied. The influence of projectile shape in the VARTM carbon/epoxy laminates under high velocity impact followed the analytical predictions by Wen [Compos. Struct. 49 (2000) 321; Compos. Sci. Technol. 61 (2001) 1163]. The conical shaped projectile resulted in highest ballistic limit, followed by the flat, hemispherical and the fragment simulating. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The determination of cohesive laws for describing large scale failure process zones is discussed. Firstly, a general approach for determination of cohesive laws, by the measurement of the J integral and end-opening of the cohesive zone of double cantilever beam specimens loaded with pure bending moments, is described. Next, two case stories are reviewed: failure of adhesive joints and splitting of a unidirectional carbon fibre/epoxy composite. For the adhesive joints, measured failure strengths of bonded panels having a central notch were found to in very good agreement with predictions from cohesive law parameters determined on test specimens. For the problem of splitting of unidirectional composites, micromechanisms were observed in situ during cracking. A cohesive law shape, predicted by a micromechanics model, was found to agree well with macroscopic cohesive law determined by the J integral approach. The cohesive law was used for predicting effect of specimen shape on strength; predictions were confirmed by experiments. Finally, some ideas regarding determination of mixed mode cohesive laws are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The present paper explores several generalized elitist procedures for the design of composite laminates. It is shown that GES procedures are superior to an SI procedure for two types of problems. The first type involves many global optima, and the GES procedure can find several global optima more efficiently than the SI procedure. This may give a designer more design freedom. The second type of problem involves an isolated optimum surrounded by many designs with performance that is very close to optimal. It is shown that GES procedures can find the optimum and near optimal designs much more easily and reliably than the SI procedure.},

Three important issues involved have been systematically addressed, i.e.,stress calculation for the constituent fiber and matrix materials, failure detection for the lamina and laminate upon the internal stresses in their constituents, and input data determination of the constituents from monolithic measurements.There are three important factors to influence the accuracy of the strength prediction. One is the stress concentration factor(SCF) in the matrix. Another is matrix plasticity. The third is thermal residual stresses in the constituents. It is these three factors, however, that have not been sufficiently well realized in the composite community. One can easily find out the elastic and strength parameters of a great many laminae and laminates in the current literature. Unfortunately, necessary information to determine the SCF, the matrix plasticity,and the thermal residual stresses of the composites is rare or incomplete. A useful design methodology is demonstrated in the paper.},

abstract = {A critical assessment is carried out of the microstructural changes in respect of the associated reductions in material mechanical properties and of the attendant ballistic-impact failure mechanisms in prototypical friction stir welding (FSW) joints found in armor structures made of high-performance aluminum alloys (including solution-strengthened and age-hardenable aluminum alloy grades). It is argued that due to the large width of FSW joints found in thick aluminum-armor weldments, the overall ballistic performance of the armor is controlled by the ballistic limits of its weld zones (e.g., heat-affected zone, the thermome- chanically affected zone, the nugget, etc.). Thus, in order to assess the overall ballistic survivability of an armor weldment, one must predict/identify welding-induced changes in the material microstructure and properties, and the operative failure mechanisms in different regions of the weld. Toward this end, a procedure is proposed in the present study which combines the results of the FSW process modeling, basic physical-metallurgy principles concerning microstructure/property relations, and the fracture mechanics concepts related to the key blast/ballistic-impact failure modes. The utility of this procedure is demonstrated using the case of a solid-solution strengthened and cold-worked aluminum alloy armor FSW-weld test structure. Keywords},

The experiments have been designed to achieve two objectives: (i) to demonstrate the benefits of sandwich construction, and (ii) to assess the fidelity of dynamic finite element calculations in simulating the structural response. The results affirm that, when subjected to impulse levels representative of those associated with nearby explosions, the sandwich beams exhibit smaller displacements than the solid beams at equivalent weight. The benefit is especially large at lower impulses where the effective dynamic strength of the honeycomb core prevents crushing. The measurements and finite element simulations having greatest relevance to the shock resistance are found to correspond closely, particularly the displacements and the core crushing strains. One implication is that the dynamic finite element model has the requisite fidelity at impulse levels of interest. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper describes the damage development in ceramics with and without composite cover during ballistic impact. This is relevant for ceramic inserts in body armor that are often covered with a composite material. To study the effect of the cover on the damage development in the ceramic, projectile impact experiments were performed at sub-muzzle velocities on bare alumina tiles and plates covered with a fiberglass composite. In addition to the experiments, finite element simulations were performed. An atypical formulation was used; Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) for the projectile and Lagrangian for the ceramic target. For the ceramic target, an unconventional material model was chosen; the pseudo-geological model 72{\_}R3 in LS-DYNA. Cracking damage in the recovered plates was characterized in a manner that clearly distinguished between cracking mechanisms and allowed the cracks to be tracked and quantified. In light of the common use of composite cover for ceramics in body armor, an unexpected result was found; that the covered plates showed significantly more damage than the bare plates. The simulations successfully matched details of the cracking patterns and elucidated the damage evolution in the ceramic plates. The simulation results explained the damage observations as the result of restraining effects, i.e. the restraining effect of the composite cover keeps the damaged ceramic in the path of the projectile resulting in increased damage.},

Additionally, loading of steel plates by the impinging detonation products was captured by high-speed video recordings. This experimental program has produced results which can be used to calibrate numerical models and to refine the simplified models for predicting blast loads and response of structural elements due to close-in detonations.

Target thicknesses of 5.4-mm, 7.5-mm and 9.6-mm impacted by a rigid hemi-spherical projectile were simulated.

A significant performance improvement was recorded for the 5.4-mm nacre-like plate (compared to the same thickness bulk plate), which was explained by the hierarchical structure facilitating both localised energy absorption (by deformation of the tablet) and more globalized energy absorption (by inter-layered delamination and friction). For a given projectile, however, the performance improvement of using the proposed composite decreased with increasing laminate thickness, which was attributed to the increased likelihood of ductile failure occurring prior to perforation in thicker bulk plates. For 5.4-mm thick plates impacted at high velocity, the nacre-like plate had a better ballistic performance than that of the plates made of continuous (flat and wavy) layers, which was attributed to the larger area of plastic deformation (observed in the nacre-like plate after impact) due to the tablets arrangement. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper describes the fatigue behaviour of newly developed all-polypropylene (all-PP) tapes and composites, with reference to the composite processing conditions, testing temperature and making a comparison with commercial alternatives. All-PP tapes are highly oriented and their failure behaviour follows that of other highly oriented polymers. All-PP woven composites fail ultimately due to PP tape failure. However, this failure mode is accompanied by delamination of fabrics in the woven structure. Consolidation pressure plays a decisive role in controlling the interlaminar properties and hence the delamination resistance and furthermore the fatigue limit of the composite. Comparison of all-PP woven composites with commercial alternatives based on glass and natural fibres reveals the excellent relative performance of all-PP composites under fatigue loads. Fatigue properties of all-PP composites are however sensitive to the testing temperature, and elevated temperatures can lead to a rapid reduction of the fatigue resistance of these all-polymer systems.},

@article{Wierzbicki2005,
abstract = {Over the past 5 years, there has been increasing interest of the automotive, aerospace, aluminum, and steel industries in numerical simulation of the fracture process of typical structural materials. Accordingly, there is a pressure on the developers of leading commercial codes, such as ABAQUS, LS-DYNA, and PAM-CRASH to implement reliable fracture criteria into those codes. Even though there are several options to address fracture in these and other commercial codes, no guidelines are given for the users as to which fracture criterion is suitable for a particular application and how to calibrate a given material for fracture. The objective of the present paper is to address the above issues and present a thorough comparative study of seven fracture criteria that are included in libraries of material models of non-linear finite element codes. A set of 15 tests recently conducted by the authors on 2024-T351 aluminum alloy is taken as a reference for the present study. The plane stress prevails in all these tests. These experiments are compared with the constant equivalent strain criterion, the Xue–Wierzbicki (X–W) fracture criterion, the Wilkins (W), the Johnson–Cook (J–C) and the CrachFEM fracture models. Additionally, the maximum shear (MS) stress model, and the fracture forming limit diagram (FFLD) are included in the present evaluation. All criteria are formulated in the general 3-D case for the power law hardening materials and then are specified for the plane stress condition. The advantage of working with plane stress is that there is one-to-one mapping from the stress to the strain space. Therefore, the fracture criteria formulated in the stress space can be compared with those expressed in the strain space and vice versa. Fracture loci for all seven cases were constructed in the space of the equivalent fracture strain and the stress triaxiality. Interesting observations were made regarding the range of applicability and expected errors of some of the most common fracture criteria. Besides evaluating the applicability of several fracture criteria, a detailed calibration procedure for each criterion is presented in the present paper. It was found rather unexpectedly that the MS stress fracture model closely follows the trend of all tests except the round bar tensile tests. The X–W criterion and the CrachFEM models predict correctly fracture in all types of experiments. The W criterion is working well in certain ranges of the stress triaxiality.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of experimental investigations conducted to determine the fundamental behavior of steel members under fire loading. A total of eleven full-scale steel members were tested under combined thermal and structural loading. First, five A992 steel beam-columns (W10 × 68) were tested to determine their fundamental moment-curvature responses at elevated temperatures and different axial load levels. The experimental approach involved the use of radiant heating and control equipment to apply the thermal loading, and close-range photogrammetry combined with digital image processing techniques to measure the deformations (curvature) in the heated zone. Next, six A992 steel wide-flange (W8 × 35 and W14 × 53) columns were tested to determine their inelastic buckling behavior and axial load-displacement responses at elevated temperatures. A self-reacting test frame was designed to subject the column specimens to axial loading and heating. The thermal loading was applied by using the same type of radiant heating and control equipment as the beam-column specimens. The measured behaviors (and strengths) of the tested beam-column and columns specimens are presented and then compared with those obtained from detailed 3D finite-element analyses. The experimental investigations showed that the fundamental behavior and strength of steel members is governed mostly by the steel surface temperature, and the strength and stiffness of steel columns decreases significantly with increasing temperatures, particularly in the range from 500–600°C. The elevated temperature behavior of steel members can be predicted reasonably by using detailed 3D finite-element models. These verified models are recommended for conducting analytical parametric studies. The experimental approaches are recommended for evaluating the fire behavior of other structural members and loading conditions.},

abstract = {A general analytical solution is obtained in this paper for an infinite elastic plate with a traction-free elliptic hole subjected to arbitrary biaxial loading. The boundary-value problem is solved by using the complex potential method, but the usual two-fold conformal transformations are avoided by employing the elliptic-hyperbolic coordinate system, which is physical and natural. All expressions for stress and displacement fields are derived in explicit form to provide a complete analysis and to make the solution ready for engineering use. With two adjustable parameters - the biaxial loading factor $\lambda$ and the orientation angle $\beta$ - contained in these expressions, the present solution furnishes a most general account of the elliptic hole problem. It is shown that all existing solutions, including the solution of a cracked plate under biaxial loading, can be obtained from this general solution. In addition, the solution for an important biaxial loading case characterizing thin-walled cylindrical pressure vessels, which has not been reported before, is also derived in the paper as a specific case of the general solution.},

abstract = {The main objective of the present study is to introduce a new fiber metal laminate (FML), formed by sandwiching a 3D fiberglass fabric in between thin sheets of magnesium alloy. In particular, the low-velocity impact (LVI) response and failure modes of this new FML composite are investigated experimentally and computationally. In addition, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the response of the FML, its performance is compared against those of conventional FMLs, made with various layers of biaxial woven fabrics in place of the 3D fabric. The failure modes of the specimens are characterized based on the quantitative measurements of shape, type, and extent of damage on the FMLs' constituents. The impact characteristics of all panels are further examined by characterizing and comparing their energy absorption capacity, residual deformation and maximum deformation due to LVI. The characteristics of the new 3D glass fabric are specifically discussed, and its positive attributes and limitations, in comparison to woven fabrics, are highlighted. The results would reveal that FML made by the 3D fabric exhibits outstanding impact absorption capacity; however, their impact energy resistance is lower than FMLs formed by woven fabrics. Moreover, as a major part of this study, a finite element analysis (FEA) framework is constructed, using the commercial finite element code ABAQUS, in order to simulate the response of such complex structures. Good agreement between the experimental and computational results demonstrate that the simulation framework can be further used to optimize the configuration of FMLs for different loading situations.},

The optimization objective is to maximize the bucking load of a symmetric and balanced laminated plate. Performance and sensitivity to the parameters harmony memory size (HMS), harmony memory consideration rate (HMCR) and pitch adjusting rate (PAR) are determined based on the algorithm apparent reliability. A modified version of the pitch adjustment is proposed and its positive impact on the reliability is demonstrated. The best performance of the basic HSA is obtained using low PAR with high HMS and HMCR. The variants of HSA consider a linear variation of the pitch adjusting rate during the optimization. Increasing PAR reduce the HSA sensitivity to this parameter and lead to fast rise of reliability in the beginning of the optimization and high reliability at the end of the search. Decreasing PAR resulted in excellent reliability for long searches, but the chance to find a global optimum is drastically reduced for short optimizations. The last example demonstrate that HSA is more efficient than other metaheuristic methods, although it is less reliable than a special version of genetic algorithm.},

abstract = {The present paper investigates the dynamic compression and impact behaviour of a new class of open-cell Ni/Al-hybrid metal foams (nickel strengthened aluminium foams) in comparison to pure aluminium foams. In order to determine the characteristics of the pure aluminium and Ni/Al-hybrid foams, dynamic compression tests using a classical split Hopkinson pressure bar have been performed at strain rates up to 5000 s-1. Whereas the pure aluminium foams show only slight strain rate sensitivity, the hybrid foams are highly strain rate sensitive. The stress strain characteristics show a change in the deformation behaviour of the foams from bending dominated failure under quasi-static compression to a failure mode induced by microinertia effects under dynamic loading with additional stretching. As a fact of this additional stretching the hybrid foams are able to dissipate more energy under dynamic loading. Further ballistic impact tests have been performed on foam sandwich panels at impact velocities of 300 m/s. The hybrid foams show a significant improved ballistic protection performance especially in the case of elastomeric fillings. The paper outlines the possible application of Ni/Al-hybrid foams as crash absorber, security panels in case of blast and ballistic impact. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Projectiles with three different nose shapes (blunt, hemispherical and conical) have been used in gas gun experiments to penetrate 12mm thick Weldox 460E steel plates. Based on the experimental results, the residual velocity curves of the target material were constructed and compared. It was found that the nose shape of the projectile significantly affected both the energy absorption mechanism and the failure mode of the target during penetration. The ballistic limit velocities were about equal and close to 300m/s for hemispherical and conical projectiles, while it was considerably lower for blunt projectiles. Blunt projectiles caused failure by plugging, which is dominated by shear banding, while hemispherical and conical projectiles penetrated the target mainly by pushing the material in front of the projectile aside. Also, the residual velocity curves were influenced by nose shape, partly due to the differences in projectile deformation at impact. The experimental study, given in this part of the paper forms the basis for explicit finite element analysis using the commercial code LS-DYNA presented in Part II of the paper. {\textcopyright} 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Open cell, lattice truss structures have been made by folding perforated 6061 aluminium alloy sheets. Simple air brazing is used to construct sandwich panels with cellular core relative densities between 0.02 and 0.08. Some panels were quenched and aged while others were tested in an annealed condition. The measured peak compressive strengths varied from 0.7 to 20 MPa, increasing with core relative density and parent alloy yield strength. The peak strength of the annealed lattice significantly exceeds ideal-plastic predictions. A model based on inelastic column theory incorporating strain hardening was able to predict the lattice truss core's compressive peak strength capacity in both the annealed and age hardened conditions, for all relative densities tested. Comparisons with compressive strength data for other cellular metals indicate that wrought aluminium alloy tetrahedral lattice structures outperform aluminium foams and prismatic corrugations, and compare favorably with honeycombs when the strain hardening of the parent alloy is high. Their impact energy absorption can be similarly tuned and competes well with other concepts under high intensity loading conditions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Acta Materialia Inc.

Comparison of the impact energy absorption between the model and experiment is used as the validation metric. Additionally, non-destructive evaluation, including ultrasonic scans and three-dimensional computed tomography, provide qualitative validation of the models. The simulations include delamination, matrix cracks and fiber breaks. An orthotropic damage and failure constitutive model, capable of predicting progressive damage and failure, is developed in conjunction and described. An ensemble of simulations incorporating model parameter uncertainties is used to predict a response distribution which is then compared to experimental output using appropriate statistical methods. Finally, the model form errors are exposed and corrected for use in an additional blind validation analysis. The result is a quantifiable confidence in material characterization and model physics when simulating low velocity impact in structures of interest.},

abstract = {This paper revisits a classical fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problem on the momentum and energy transfer to a structure from an underwater blast. Hitherto, the majority of analytical models assume a rigid (non-deformable) and free-standing (unsupported) structure where resistance to its translational motion – apart from that offered by its inertial mass – comes from ‘ad-hoc' backing spring(s) introduced to simulate compression of the fluid medium and/or the resistance to transverse deformation encountered by a real structure. These limitations/assumptions are relaxed in this paper by adopting a physically realistic fully-clamped ductile beam system that takes into account large elasto-plastic deformation, limits to material deformation, boundary compliance and boundary failure; the analytical framework was developed previously by Yuan et al. (2016). By coupling the fluid (water) domain to the analytical model of the ductile beam system, the momentum and energy transferred by the blast wave are critically re-evaluated for non-impulsive loading r{\'{e}}gime; in particular, on how the beam's deformation mode and boundary compliance affects fluid and structure interaction, up until the point of complete beam detachment from its supports. Detailed finite-element models were also developed to simulate the interactions between the fluid and structural beam where predictions were in good agreement with those by the analytical model. Sensitivity analyses were carried out that offer new insights on the influence of the beam's aspect ratio and inertial mass.},

It is concluded that the damage zone around a Z-pin plays an important role in influencing the stiffness and strength of the Z-pin composite.

The model is based on a set of basic hypotheses common to other previous analytical models developed in our department and elsewhere. However, this new model is of a more refined nature acquisition that allows for reliable results without requiring the use of parametric data needed in previous models. For the first time, the model provides a qualitative explanation of the sudden drop of energy absorbed by the target with impact velocities slightly higher than the ballistic limit. A qualitative explanation, experimentally observed, of the shape of woven fabric laminates after impact is also noted. The model predictions of both ballistic limit and residual velocity after perforation reasonably agree with experimental results, in spite of the use of static data of the target material. Thus, this model may serve as a useful tool for a primary stage of composite armour design, permitting a large number of parameters to be screened before using higher cost numerical and experimental approaches. {\textcopyright} IMechE 2013.},

This work aims to fulfil this gap, presenting experimental data regarding the influence of temperature and strain rate on the fracture energy in mode II, GIIC, of composite plates. Significant influence of the strain rate and temperature on GIICof the composite materials was found. Higher strain rates led to a decrease of GIICup to 17{\%}. An increase of temperature corresponded to an increase of GIICup to 15{\%} and a decrease of temperature originated a decrease of GIICup to 7{\%}.},

Sources of energy dissipation considered are plastic deformations of the PC and the PMMA, cracking of the PMMA, viscous deformations of the adhesive, and the energy used to deform failed elements that are deleted from the analysis domain. Some of the challenging issues are appropriate constitutive relations for the three materials, failure criteria, and numerical techniques to accurately analyze finite deformations of different constituents. We model the PC and the PMMA as thermo-elasto-visco-plastic materials with constitutive relations proposed by Mulliken and Boyce and modified by Varghese and Batra, the adhesive as a visco-elastic material, and use the commercial finite element software LS-DYNA in which these material models have been implemented as user defined subroutines. This software is coupled with a genetic algorithm to optimize the layup of the PC, the PMMA and the adhesive layers of the same thickness under the constraints that the top and the bottom layers are not adhesive, the PC and the PMMA layers must have an adhesive layer between them, and the total number of layers is fixed.},

abstract = {In this paper, high velocity impact responses of newly designed sandwich panels with aluminium (AL) foam core and metal fibre laminate (FML) skins, which are comprised of aluminium sheets and plain woven E glass fibre composite plies are investigated. Gas gun impact tests were conducted to investigate the high velocity impact response of the panels subjected to the impact from a steel ball bearing at an impact velocity of around 210 m/s. The effect of the thickness of the foam core and FML skin on the impact resistance of the panels is also investigated via experimental study. A finite element model is developed for effective numerical modelling of the impact behaviour of the sandwich panels using the commercially finite element software ANSYS LS-DYNA for more extensive study of the impact response of the sandwich panels. The simplified Johnson Cook material model, the composite damage material model based on the Chang-Chang criteria, and the crushable foam material model are used to model the aluminium sheets, composite plies and the AL foam respectively. Three types of contact algorithms, i.e. the erosion contact type, the tie-break contact type and the general 3D contact type are employed to define the various contacts during the impact and to model the delamination between the FML layers and debonding between the FML skin and the AL foam. The finite element model is validated by comparing the simulated impact behaviour to that from experimental for a sandwich panel subjected to high speed impact and demonstrated to be effective and accurate. The effect of the shape of projectile and impact angle on the impact behaviour of the sandwich panels is studied using the developed finite element model.
